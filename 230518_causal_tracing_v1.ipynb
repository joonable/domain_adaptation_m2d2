       " '0,\"Francis Albert \"\"Frank\"\" Sinatra (born December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey), grew up in a tenement with his parents, who had emigrated from Italy.\"',\n",
       " '1,Family background and early years.',\n",
       " '2,\"Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina \"\"Dolly\"\" Garaventa and Antonino Martino \"\"Marty\"\" Sinatra. The couple had eloped on Valentine\\'s Day, 1913, and were married at the city hall in Jersey City, New Jersey; they later got remarried in a church. Sinatra weighed at birth. His was a breech birth; he had to be with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism was delayed for several months. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he suffered from cystic acne that scarred his face and neck. Some children called him \"\"Scarface\"\" when he was eleven; this made him so angry he wanted to physically assault the doctor who had delivered him. Sinatra was raised Roman Catholic.\"',\n",
       " '3,\"When Sinatra\\'s mother, Natalina, was a child, her pretty face earned her the nickname \"\"Dolly\"\". As an adult, she stood less than five feet tall and weighed approximately 90 pounds. Sinatra biographer James Kaplan describes her as having a \"\"politician\\'s temperament—restless, energetic, unreflective\"\". She was the daughter of a lithographer. Born in Genoa in northern Italy, she was brought to the United States when she was two months old. Dolly was influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. She used her knowledge of Italian dialects and fluent English to translate for immigrants during court proceedings, particularly those pertaining to requests for citizenship. This earned her the respect of local politicians, who made her a Democratic ward leader. She was the first immigrant woman to hold that position in her local third ward, and reliably delivered as many as six hundred votes for Democratic candidates. In 1919, she chained herself to city hall in support of the Women\\'s suffrage movement. She also worked as a midwife, earning $50 for each delivery, a fair amount of money at the time. These activities kept Dolly away from home during much of her son\\'s childhood. Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley claims that Dolly also ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls, and was so well known for this doctors referred their patients to her, for whom she would travel as far afield as Jersey City and Union City.\"',\n",
       " '4,\"Sinatra\\'s father, Antonino\\xa0– a small, blue-eyed, ruddy-complexioned man\\xa0– was from Lercara Friddi, near Palermo, Sicily. His parents had originally been vineyard cultivators. He arrived at Ellis Island with his mother and sisters in 1903, when they joined his father, Francesco Sinatra, who had immigrated to the US in 1900. Francesco worked for 17 years at the American Pencil company, which \"\"wrecked his lungs\"\" according to granddaughter Nancy. Antonino was a bantamweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O\\'Brien. Though a boxer, who would talk \"\"loud and rough\"\", he had a gentle, reserved demeanor. He retired from boxing in 1926, after having broken both wrists, and later found work on the docks as a boilermaker, but was soon laid off due to problems with asthma. He served with the Hoboken Fire Department for 24 years, working his way up to Captain. Kaplan claims that Marty never learned to read.\"',\n",
       " '5,\"In 1920, Prohibition of alcohol became law in the US. Dolly and Marty ran a tavern during those years, allowed to operate openly by local officials who refused to enforce the law. Kaplan notes the possibility that the Sinatras procured their liquor from members of the American Mafia. They purchased the bar, which they named Marty O\\'Brien\\'s, with money they borrowed from Dolly\\'s parents. When they were busy with the tavern, Sinatra was watched by relatives and sometimes a Jewish neighbor named Mrs. Goldberg, who taught him Yiddish. When Sinatra was six, his uncle Babe, Dolly\\'s brother, was arrested for driving a getaway car after a Railway Express truck driver was murdered. Though Dolly attended his trial daily and attempted to evoke sympathy, her brother was convicted and sentenced to prison for 15 years. Other family members had minor clashes with the law; Sinatra\\'s father and uncles had been arrested for assorted minor offenses. Sinatra later recalled spending time at the bar, working on his homework and occasionally singing a song on top of the player piano for spare change. During the Great Depression, Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends, and for him to buy expensive clothes. He also earned pocket money by singing on street corners. Neighbors described him as the \"\"best-dressed kid in the neighborhood\"\" and the \"\"richest kid on the block\"\", aided by the fact that he was an only child, and had his own bedroom. According to Kaplan, Dolly doted on her son, but she also abused him when he angered her, hitting him with small bat she kept at Marty O\\'Brien\\'s. Excessively thin and small as a child and young man, Sinatra\\'s skinny frame later became a staple of his own jokes and those of the Rat Pack members during stage shows, one self-effacing joke being: \"\"A little kid, skinny. So skinny my eyes were single file. Between those two and my belly button my old man thought I was a clarinet\"\".\"',\n",
       " '6,Education and musical development.',\n",
       " '7,\"Sinatra developed an interest in music, particularly big band jazz, from a young age, and became addicted to listening to the radio, \"\"entranced by the new musical and comedy routines and captivated by the huge audiences they commanded\"\", according to biographer Chris Rojek. He began singing at a young age, sitting on top of the piano at his parent\\'s bar in Hoboken, \"\"Marty\\'s O\\'Brien\\'s. Dolly was not enthusiastic at the idea of her son becoming a singer, but she realized when Sinatra was as young as 11 he had something. Sinatra later recalled: \"\"One day, I got a nickel. I said \"\"This is the racket\"\". I thought, \"\"It\\'s wonderful to sing... I never forgot it.\"\" During his early teenage years Sinatra forced himself to develop his voice. wanting to \"\"make something of himself\"\". He listened heavily to Gene Austin, Rudy Vallée, Russ Colombo and Bob Eberly, and \"\"idolized\"\" Bing Crosby, adopting Crosby\\'s props such as a sailor\\'s cap and pipe in his own performances. Sinatra\\'s maternal uncle, Domenico, gave him a ukulele for his 15th birthday, and he began performing at family gatherings.\"',\n",
       " '8,\"Sinatra graduated from David E. Rue Junior High, and enrolled at A. J. Demarest High School on January 28, 1931, where he arranged bands for school dances. He left without graduating, having attended only 47 days before being expelled for \"\"general rowdiness\"\". The school principal, Arthur Stover stated that he \"\"showed no real talent for anything\"\", while Macy Hagerty, his Math teacher, described him as a \"\"lazy boy\"\" with \"\"absolutely no ambition at all when it came to school\"\". Sinatra\\'s father was particularly disappointed with his son, hoping that he would make it to college. Sinatra recalled his father scolding him in his strong local accent on the school step after Stover ordered Sinatra senior to \"\"get him out\"\", exclaiming, \"\"What\\'s the matter with you? You don\\'t want to learn nothing?\"\" To please his mother, he enrolled at Drake Business School, but departed after 11 months.\"',\n",
       " '9,Early career.',\n",
       " '10,\"Sinatra\\'s father, who knew that his son was interested in getting into show business, insisted that his son find a \"\"real job\"\" to avoid becoming a \"\"bum\"\" after leaving school. Dolly found him work as a delivery boy at the \"\"Jersey Observer\"\" newspaper, where his godfather Frank Garrick worked, and briefly as a riveter at the Tietjen and Lang shipyard. She was also responsible for his job at the Union Club at 600 Hudson Street in Hoboken, run by Joseph Samperi, where he was paid $40 a week for five weeks. He performed in local Hoboken social clubs such as The Cat\\'s Meow and The Comedy Club, and sang for free on radio stations such as WAAT in Jersey City. In New York he found jobs singing for his supper or for cigarettes. Sinatra began taking 45-minute elocution lessons for a dollar an hour under New York-based vocal coach John Quinlan to improve his speech. Quinlan was impressed by his vocal range, remarking, \"\"He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn\\'t need a mike either\"\". Years later, Sinatra professed that he had never had a proper vocal lesson, but that Quinlan had simply helped him work on vocal calisthenics to \"\"help the throat grow and add a couple of notes on the top and spread the bottom\"\".\"',\n",
       " '11,\"In 1938, Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter at a roadhouse called The Rustic Cabin in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, for which he was paid $15 a week. The roadhouse was connected to the WNEW radio station in New York City, and Sinatra began performing with a group live during the \"\"Dance Parade\"\" show. Despite the low salary, he felt that this was the break he was looking for, and boasted to friends that he was going to \"\"become so big that no one could ever touch him\"\". Fellow musicians began to resent his cocksure attitude, and according to one Jersey city musician, Sam Lefaso, Sinatra was mocked for displaying little talent and having a \"\"tight, high voice\"\", which sounded \"\"awful\"\". When they told him that he was a lousy singer, Sinatra would flare up, angrily cursing and swearing at the others.\"',\n",
       " '12,\"It was while working at The Cabin that he became involved in a dispute between his girlfriend Toni Della Penta, who suffered a miscarriage, and Nancy Barbato, a stonemason\\'s daughter, in 1939. Sinatra had met Barbato in Long Branch, New Jersey, where he spent most of the summer working as a lifeguard. After Della Penta attempted to tear off Barbato\\'s dress, Sinatra ordered Barbato away and told Della Penta that he would marry Barbato, several years his junior, because she was pregnant. Della Penta went to the police, and Sinatra was arrested on a morals charge for seduction. After a fight between Della Penta and Dolly, Della Penta was later arrested herself. Sinatra married Barbato that year, and Nancy Sinatra was born the following year.\"',\n",

He is known for his appearance in the remakes of Telugu films during the 1980s, in which he was frequently cast opposite Sridevi and Jaya Prada. One of the most greatest and successful film stars in the Bollywood film industry, he serves as the chairman of the Balaji Telefilms, Balaji Motion Pictures and ALT Entertainment.\"',\n",

However, it was the film \"\"Farz\"\" (1967) that served as his stepping stone to success. The tee shirt and white shoes he picked up from a retail store for the \"\"Mast Baharon Ka Main Aashiq\"\" number in \"\"Farz\"\", became his trademark. \"\"Farz\"\" was followed by films such as \"\"Caravan\"\" and \"\"Humjoli\"\", in which Jeetendra had more dance numbers. His vigorous dancing in the films won him the epithet; \"\"Jumping Jack of Bollywood\"\".\"',\n",
       " '22,\"He has acted in nearly 200 films as the main lead, a feat matched by just a handful of his peers since the inception of Hindi cinema.

Raghavendra Rao and Dasari Narayana Rao; these included \"\"Sanjog\"\", \"\"Aulad\"\", \"\"Majaal\"\", \"\"Justice Chaudhury\"\", \"\"Mawaali\"\" (1983), \"\"Himmatwala\"\" (1983) and \"\"Tohfa\"\" (1984). He also acted in many remakes in Hindi of Krishna\\'s Telugu movies and had very close association with him. Besides these south Indian remakes, there was a subdued side of Jeetendra whenever he\\'d worked with the writer/lyricist Gulzar in films such as \"\"Parichay\"\", \"\"Kinara\"\" and \"\"Khushboo\"\" that had several beautifully penned songs such as \"\"O Majhi Re\"\", \"\"Musafir Hoon Yaaron\"\" and \"\"Naam Gum Jaayega\"\", composed by Rahul Dev Burman and sung by Kishore Kumar.\"',\n",

When Jeetendra was struggling between 1960–66 to establish himself as an actor, he was in a relationship with Shobha and she was his girlfriend until 1972. It was not until the release of \"\"Bidaai\"\" on 18 October 1974, that Jeetendra and Shobha decided to get married, which they did in a simple ceremony at Janki Kutir with only a few family members and friends present (Gulzar, Rajesh Khanna and Sanjeev Kumar amongst the noted celebrities). In her authorized biography, Hema Malini claimed that they almost got married, but she backed out.\"',\n",

The award category was originally called Outstanding Young Man or Outstanding Juvenile Male in a Drama Series, and began using its current title in 1991. Years before this category was introduced, networks declined to broadcast the show during a time of voting integrity rumors and waning interest. Confusion rose around the criteria of the new category due to the varying ages of the nominees. Within the first set of nominees, Bloom became the youngest actor nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award at the time at age 15, while the other actors nominated in the category were over 25. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actor be aged 25 or below.\"',\n",

In her memoir Tennille revealed that despite their success and public image of a solid marriage, she was lonely and isolated. Dragon had been controlling and emotionally distant; throughout their relationship they slept in separate bedrooms. \"\"I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,\"\" she said.

       " '142,\"The LGBT Aging Project is a Boston-based non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults have equal access to life-prolonging benefits, protection, services and institutions as heterosexual and cisgender adults. Founded in 2001, the project provides cultural competence and institutional capacity training to elder service providers on how to create and sustain LGBT welcoming environments, develop community-building programs for LGBT older adults and caregivers, and also works to enact policy and legislative changes to improve access to care and benefits for LGBT elders. . The LGBT Aging Project was recently featured in the 2010 award-winning documentary Gen Silent.\"',\n",
       " '143,History.',\n",
       " '144,\"The LGBT Aging Project was founded in 2001 by a group of advocates from the aging service network and individuals from the LGBT community. The Greater Boston LGBT Aging Summit was held in June 2001 in order to create an action plan for the needs of LGBT elders. In the fall of 2001, the action plan created at the summit was released at a Massachusetts state house press conference.\"',\n",
       " '145,\"In 2002, the LGBT Aging Project began organizing work groups on aging and health policy, training and programs delveopment, housing and the creation of new programs within the project. The project also hired their first full-time director, Amy Hunt, and received a funding grant from the Boston Foundation. It was also in 2002 that the project defined their mission as \"\"ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults and their caregivers have equal access to the life-prolonging benefits, protections, services and institutions that their heterosexual neighbors take for granted.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '146,\"The year 2003 proved to be a major time of legislative change and policy action and advocacy for the LGBT Aging Project. The LGBT Aging Project was involved with marriage equality advocacy – through testimonies at the Massachusetts State House by both LGBT Aging Project members as well as LGBT older adults. Also in 2003, the LGBT Aging Project became more visible in the community through numerous presentations & events, such as the first Boston Pride Tea Dance for LGBT elders and their friends. The first LGBT caregiver support group also started in 2003 after the LGBT Aging Project was awarded an initial grant from the Caregiver Alliance of Suffolk County.\"',\n",
       " '147,\"On May 17, 2004, marriage equality became a reality for the state of Massachusetts, partly due to the role that the LGBT Aging Project played in legislative advocacy for the cause. The LGBT Aging Project lost Amy Hunt as its director during 2004, and gained its current executive director, Lisa Krinsky. The LGBT Aging Project also made great strides in its development as it created a pilot program for the \"\"Open Door Task Force\"\" LGBT cultural competency training program, initiated trainings with major Area Agencies on Aging and Aging Service Access Points in Massachusetts, and opened Café Emmanuel with Ethos, a Boston area Aging Service Access Point. Café Emmanuel is Massachusetts’ first federally funded meal program for LGBT older adults and their friends.\"',\n",
       " '148,\"Since 2005, the LGBT Aging Project has hosted numerous community forums for LGBT elders and held many state funded LGBT training and outreach sessions within the state Elder Service Network. In 2006, Bob Linscott, the current assistant director, was hired as a part-time outreach worker and site coordinator for Café Emmanuel. The year 2007 saw Bob rise to the full-time assistant director, and the LGBT Aging Project sponsored a number of events, including the Pride week event, \"\"LGBT Veterans Share their Stories\"\" and Stu Maddux’s film, “Bob and Jack’s 52 Year Adventure” at the Boston LGBT Film Festival. The LGBT Aging Project also launched a second LGBT friendly meal program with Ethos, “Out to Brunch”, for lesbian, bisexual and transgender women.\"',\n",
       " '149,\"In 2008, a major stride was made in the Massachusetts state legislation with the passage of the MassHealth Equality Law, largely due to the work done by the LGBT Aging Project. This law ensures that same sex couples who are legally married in Massachusetts have equal access to eligibility evaluation when applying for the state\\'s Medicaid program.\"',\n",
       " '150,\"Since 2010, the LGBT Aging Project has secured funding to create LGBT bereavement support groups and healthy aging programs.

The episodes were originally broadcast in the United States on February 4, 1966 and February 11, 1966 on NBC. The film is directed by E. Darrell Hallenbeck and written by Howard Rodman. It, as does the television series, stars Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. It is the fourth such feature film that used as its basis a reedited version of one or more episodes from the series. However, this film, and the episodes it draws from, represents the only instance where a Man from U.N.C.L.E. story is derived from an existing novel: \"\"The Bridge of Lions\"\" (1963) by Henry Slesar.\"',\n",

       " '167,\"Illya Kuryakin is investigating the theft of cats in the Soho area of London, and Napoleon Solo is on a mission to determine the whereabouts of the famous, suddenly youthful appearing, and now missing 83-year-old biologist Benjamin Lancer. Solo contacts Lancer\\'s daughter Lorelei, a model at the Paris salon of Madame Raine De Sala. De Sala orders her associate Olga and another model Do Do to make sure that Lorelei does not speak to Solo.\"',\n",
       " '168,\"De Sala herself visits Sir Norman Swickert, a very old statesman she knew and admired as a child, and brings along with her Dr. Gritsky – a colleague of Dr. Lancer. Swickert complains of being too old to have political power anymore, and De Sala reveals her desire for such power as he once had, her resentment of not having it available to her since she is a woman, and her ability to make him a younger man with Gritsky\\'s help.\"',\n",
       " '169,\"Meanwhile, Solo\\'s efforts to contact Lorelei result in Do Do and Olga acting together to kill her rather than have her speak to Solo. Solo discovers this when he is lured to Lorelei\\'s apartment and, after a fight with Do Do, discovers both Lorelei\\'s body and a note to Lorelei that she could contact her father through Philip Bainbridge. Solo attempts to contact Bainbridge in London (meeting Swickert\\'s full-time nurse Joanna Sweet in the process), but Swickert is speaking with him first. Swickert becomes convinced that the middle-aged Bainbridge is actually the elderly Lancer made young again via a medical process. Olga has followed Solo and, in attempting to kill him, accidentally kills Bainbridge/Lancer. A chase and fight ensues with the result being the escape of Olga and the death of Do Do.\"',\n",
       " '170,\"Having seen Swickert with Lancer, Solo visits Swickert at his country estate and questions him about Bainbridge and Lancer. Swickert refuses to say much beyond that Lancer was a member of the Bridge of Lions club, a private chess club that Swickert founded to build a bridge among the great men of many nations to allow them freedom to communicate under all circumstances – thereby reducing the chances of cataclysms like World War I.\"',\n",
       " '171,\"Shortly after leaving Swickert\\'s home, Solo\\'s car crashes as a result of sabotage – implied to be the work of Olga. Solo is found by THRUSH agent Jordin, who advises U.N.C.L.E. of Solo\\'s predicament and location. (The television episode had made clear that Jordin was investigating Lancer as well; the movie did not include those scenes, though, making Jordin\\'s sudden appearance and his motives for helping Solo as an enemy agent a little confusing.)\"',\n",
       " '172,\"Kuryakin, still investigating the missing cats, tracks one of them to a laboratory. He finds the cat de-aged to a kitten and the man said to have been capturing the cats, Corvy, dead by a hat pin. Solo (none the worse for his auto accident, which is never discussed) arrives as well and, after comparing notes the two men reach the conclusion that the cats, having a similar nervous system to humans, are being experimented upon with the de-aging process developed by Lancer and Gritsky. Kuryakin finds that hat associated with the pin and it turns out to be from Madame Raine De Sala\\'s salon. From this point on they collaborate on their assignments.\"',\n",
       " '173,\"Solo and Kuryakin next break into Swickert\\'s home and are captured by Swickert\\'s guard and Olga. Tossed into a wine press with the press descending, they are left for dead. They nonetheless figure out how to brace the press and are eventually released by Jordin after everyone else leaves the estate. After a brief interrogation by Jordin, the U.N.C.L.E. agents overpower him and, while he escapes, are again free.\"',\n",
       " '174,\"In very short order Swickert is de-aged and regains his stature as a man of power. Solo and Kuryakin confront him and demand the secret of rejuvenation. Jordin, listening covertly to their conversation, captures Gritsky and blackmails De Sala: he will only provide continued curative treatments to Swickert if De Sala uses her influence to make Swickert do THRUSH\\'s bidding in political matters. Solo finds out and is captured again.\"',\n",
       " '175,\"Because of his past association with Swickert, Waverly travels to England to speak to him, but is also captured by Jordin and placed with Solo.\"',\n",
       " '176,\"Swickert, having taken another treatment with Gritsky and learning of THRUSH\\'s plans for him, decides that Gritsky and his secret must die to keep anyone else from suffering his fate. Jordin saves Gritsky, but Swickert goes on to give a political speech wherein he explains enough of THRUSH\\'s plans that Jordin draws a gun. De Sala jumps in front of Swickert to protect him and ends up shot and killed in his stead.\"',\n",
       " '177,\"Solo, having escaped with Waverly via an incidiary rope in Waverly\\'s tie, meets up with Kuryakin to investigate Gritsky\\'s laboratory. They find Gritsky has taken Swickert\\'s worries to heart and committed suicide by de-aging rapidly to a child. Jordin comes in, takes Gritsky\\'s notes, and destroys the de-aging machine so no one else can have it. But Gritsky has booby-trapped the machine and Jordin is killed. Solo and Kuryakin return to New York, and since the secret of the de-aging process is written in code, it appears to be lost to science for a very long time.\"',\n",
       " '178,Changes from episode.',\n",
       " '179,\"The film took the second season two-part episode \"\"The Bridge of Lions Affair\"\" and, in addition to editing the length to accommodate the running time of the film by cutting and rearranging some scenes, made several major changes to the episodes. First, Leigh Chapman, who played the character of an U.N.C.L.E. communications technician named Wanda, was replaced by Yvonne Craig. Yvonne Craig had played Alexander Waverly’s niece Maude Waverly in the prior U.N.C.L.E. film \"\"One Spy Too Many\"\", but no reference was made to that character in this movie. The character remained named Wanda and, other than the replacement of the actress, the role was essentially unchanged from the television episode. Second, the character Do Do was introduced as a model who was all too willing to perform Madame Raine De Sala’s dirty work. Also new were scenes dealing with the death of Lorelei Lancer; whereas in the episodes she was strangled off screen, in the film her dead body is shown staring open-eyed from the bottom of a tub filled with water. One other significant difference is the music. The episodes’ music was darker and more sinister, in keeping with the musical style of the second season. The film, however, had music that was overtly “mod” in a 1960s style and often comical. (Also, the film had a new score composed for it by Gerald Fried, because \"\"The Bridge of Lions Affair\"\" had been tracked with music from other episodes.) The result was that many scenes played far less seriously in the movie version than in the television version.\"',\n",

However, it is reported that her brother had been threatened with deportation by , the German manager of Continental, the only film production company permitted in occupied France. She received a divorce and then fell in love with Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican Republic diplomat and notorious womanizer. They married in 1942. His anti-Nazi opinions resulted in his forced residence in Germany. In exchange for Rubirosa\\'s freedom, Darrieux agreed to make a promotional trip in Berlin. The couple lived in Switzerland until the end of the war, and divorced in 1947. She married scriptwriter Georges Mitsikidès in 1948, and they lived together until his death in 1991.\"',\n",

Their son was sent to the Crediton Grammar School until the age of 15, when the bankruptcy of the elder prompted the younger to seek employment. While the younger despaired at his fate, a random gentleman discovered him and offered him a job as an usher for a school. While working for the school, he took up a wife, had four daughters, and pursued his studies. In 1747, he was accepted into the Sidney Sussex College, at the age of 28, and studied classics and Hebrew. After finishing college, the younger John Coleridge became a teacher in Devon.\"',\n",

By 1772, the year of Samuel\\'s birth, John Coleridge was a well-respected vicar of the parish and had advanced to the position of Head Master of Henry VIII\\'s Free Grammar School at Ottery. The positions brought the family only a small income, but they did earn the friendship of the community\\'s baronet, Stafford Northcote. In addition to his employment, John Coleridge also wrote a few religious works and a Latin grammar.\"',\n",
       " '224,Childhood.',\n",
       " '225,\"Coleridge was born on 21 October 1772 in the rural town of Ottery St Mary, Devon, England, the youngest of the children. Of his childhood, Coleridge suggests that he \"\"took no pleasure in boyish sports\"\" but instead read \"\"incessantly\"\" and played by himself. He was close to his father and distant from his mother, a woman whom he would provoke in an attempt to receive her attention. At the age of seven, Coleridge ran away from home after an argument with his older brother Frank that provoked his mother to punish him. He would tell the story to his friends in his later years with particular emphasis on his mother and \"\"how miserable my Mother must be\"\" about him running away. A search party was formed with the local noble and family friend Northcote eventually being the one to find Coleridge and bring him home. This event appeared in Coleridge\\'s later poems including \"\"Monody on the Death of Chatterton\"\" (1829).\"',\n",
       " '226,\"John Coleridge died in 1781 when Samuel was 8 years-old. Since his father was a source of happiness for the young Coleridge, the death affected him deeply. He was also the only son left at home; Frank was enlisted in the Navy just prior to John\\'s death and Coleridge\\'s other brothers were busy with careers or their own families. One of the brothers, George, took responsibility for Coleridge. Of him, Coleridge declared that he was \"\"father, brother, and every thing\"\". Without his father around, Coleridge and his family were forced to move from the schoolhouse to a nearby home with a loss of their income. Soon after, one of John Coleridge\\'s former students, Judge Buller, arranged for Coleridge to be sent to Christ\\'s Hospital. Coleridge was accepted after his mother petitioned on 28 March 1782, along with Fulwood Smerdon, John Coleridge\\'s successor, and Samuel Taylor, Coleridge\\'s godfather, that he be accepted. After acceptance, he attended a school in Hertford to prepare him for Christ\\'s Hospital.\"',\n",
       " '227,Education.',\n",
       " '228,\"Christ\\'s Hospital was founded in London by Edward VI in 1552 and intended to educate orphans and the poor. By the 18th-century, it catered to educating the children of poor gentry. The age of the institution and the traditions of the school soon became a point of pride for Coleridge. He remained there throughout his childhood, studying and writing poetry, and it was at the school that he studied the works of Virgil and William Lisle Bowles. While at school, Coleridge was often in the school\\'s sanatorium for a mild feverish condition and spent time by himself reading and studying classics. Although he was known for his speech aptitude, he was also known for his poor manner of dress. He also composed poetry, mostly imitations of Milton, Gray, and others.\"',\n",
       " '229,\"During that time, Coleridge became a friend of Charles Lamb. Unlike Lamb, Coleridge did not have family in London to spend his vacation with, which caused the young Coleridge strain. Over the nine years that he attended the school, he only returned home 3 or 4 times. He experienced loneliness throughout the time until two of his brothers, Luke and George, came to London. He wrote many letters to his brothers, but only one to his mother during his time in London. Luke was important to Coleridge and Luke\\'s moving to Devon affected the schoolboy. Coleridge made other friends, including Charles Le Grice, but this could not keep Coleridge from missing Luke, to whom Coleridge would write often. In one letter, Coleridge wrote: \"\"Legrice, and I, are very polite, very civil, and very cold. So that I doubly lament your absence, as I have now no one, to whom I can open my heart in full confidence.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '230,\"With the letter was one of Coleridge\\'s first poems, \"\"Easter Holidays\"\", which discusses both present happiness and future sorrow. Another poem written that year was \"\"Dura Navis\"\", a poem that is possibly about his brother Frank and describes a state of loneliness and solitude along with battles at sea and eventual cannibalism of the crew. He continued to write poetry, including \"\"Monody\"\" (1790) which compares himself with Thomas Chatterton, an individual that committed suicide. He composed \"\"The Destruction of the Bastile\"\" that responded to the fall of the Bastille during the previous year. The poem contains Coleridge\\'s cheering on of events within revolutionary France and a possible revolution in England. While he stayed at the school\\'s sanatorium recovering from illness, Coleridge wrote the poem \"\"\"\". It was also during this time that Coleridge was first prescribed opium, in the form of laudanum, as a treatment of his fever. The deaths of his brother Luke and sister Ann in 1791 near the end of his school career prompted Coleridge to write the sonnet \"\"On Receiving an Account that his only Sister\\'s Death was Inevitable\"\".\"',\n",
       " '231,\"By 1788, Coleridge befriended a few other boys including Robert Allen and Tom Evans. Together, the three boys would visit Evans\\'s home in London. It was there that Coleridge met Mary Evans, the oldest of Tom\\'s three sisters, and Coleridge became infatuated with her. He also became attached to Tom\\'s mother, a woman that later took care of the boys over Coleridge\\'s 1791 Christmas vacation for college. Coleridge later told George, \"\"I have indeed experienced from her a tenderness scarcely inferior to the solicitude of maternal affection.\"\" This affection developed to the point of Coleridge composing a poem \"\"To Disappointment\"\" that places Mrs. Evans in the role of his mother. His involvement with the family was the first of Coleridge\\'s long relationship with predominately female circles of friends. His feelings on the matter combined affection and sexual attraction in a way that he was uncomfortable with, and Coleridge was to later remark that he was unable to have sex with his wife because he viewed her in a sisterly manner.\"',\n",
       " '232,\"At the end of his time at Christ\\'s Hospital, he received a scholarship to attend Jesus College, Cambridge and was to begin his time at the college in September 1791. During his transition from Christ\\'s Hospital, Coleridge composed \"\"On Quitting School for College\"\", a poem that contains his saying good bye to his previous homes in a manner that was more positive than how he truly felt about those places. Although Coleridge enjoyed some of the moments at school, he believed that his time was that of deprivation and focused mostly on future happiness that would not actualize in the way he had hoped.\"',\n",
       " '233,College.',\n",
       " '234,\"From 1791 until 1794, Coleridge attended Jesus College. He received 70 pounds per year in scholarship to attend the school with 30 pounds from the Rustat Scholarship, a scholarship for the sons of Anglican clergymen. However, this was only enough to provide Coleridge with a meagre living at Jesus College, which he would complain of often. This was compounded by the debt that Coleridge began to accrue and avoided paying. It is uncertain how Coleridge used his income, but it is possible that he ran into debt because of indulgence in wine and opium, the drug that he continued to use throughout college. It is also possible that he spent his money on prostitutes, which he deeply regretted and even had nightmares over. He was prone to sexual nightmares, and he recorded one such dream in 1803 about being pursued by a prostitute at both Christ\\'s Hospital and Jesus College.\"',\n",
       " '235,\"Although he had few friends at first, he befriended Thomas Middleton, a student at Pembroke College, who acted as \"\"patron and protector\"\" according to Coleridge\\'s account in \"\"Biographia Literaria\"\". His education was spent working in the chapel and attending lectures in both math and classics. Coleridge also wrote many poems and submitted some for various competitions. In July 1792 he won the Browne Gold Medal for a Sapphic ode that he wrote on the slave trade. Later in December, he competed for the Craven Scholarship but didn\\'t win. He also wrote more personal poems, including one written about lost love accompanying a letter to Mary Evans on 13 February 1792. Throughout college and in his poetry, Coleridge involved himself with politics, including issues around the French revolution, the slave trade, and the abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts. Coleridge became involved with issues surrounding the Test and Corporation Acts when a tutor at Jesus College, William Frend, was placed on trial during early 1793 by the Fellows of Jesus College for being a Unitarian and no longer supporting Anglicanism. Although Frend was removed from the school in April 1793, he influenced Coleridge\\'s political and religious beliefs to the point of Coleridge eventually working as a Unitarian preacher after leaving Jesus College.\"',\n",
       " '236,\"Later in 1793, Coleridge competed for the Browne Medal but his ode on astronomy only won him second place. He wrote less poetry except for in Latin. One English poem was included in a letter to George in July 1793 called \"\"The rose\"\". Another poem was written during summer vacation called the \"\"Songs of the Pixies\"\", which described a cave near his home in Ottery that was called \"\"the Pixies\\' Parlour\"\". The poem celebrates the moment and also describes Coleridge\\'s expectations to be crowned with a poet\\'s laurels. Coleridge continued to accrue debt, 150 pounds by the summer vacation, which prompted him to leave college at the end of 1793. He used the last of his money to purchase an Irish Lottery ticket, an event which inspired him to write a poem on the matter which was published by the \"\"Morning Chronicle\"\" on 7 November 1793. Afterwards, he read a poem to a group of students at Trinity College, \"\"Lines on an Autumnal Evening\"\", which was heard by Christopher Wordsworth, brother to Coleridge\\'s eventual companion and friend, William Wordsworth.\"',\n",
       " '237,\"On 2 December 1793, he enlisted in the 15th (The King\\'s) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons using the false name \"\"Silas Tomkyn Comberbache\"\", needing a means to provide himself with food. He was a poor soldier and a struggled for three months, trading his abilities to write in return for other soldiers helping him with his horse and other matters. Coleridge\\'s true identity was revealed whilst he was serving in Reading. His captain, Nathaniel Ogle, son of the Rev. Newton Ogle, Dean of Winchester Cathedral, found a plaintive Latin exclamation written on the wall of the stables. On discovering its author was Comberback, Ogle quickly uncovered the real persona behind it and Coleridge\\'s old Christ\\'s Hospital schoolmate, G. L. Tuckett, was told of the enlistment and he informed George Coleridge. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later under the reason of \"\"insanity\"\", and George paid off Coleridge\\'s debt. Eventually, Coleridge was readmitted to Jesus College in April 1794 and began writing poetry again. During June 1794, he advertised an edition of poems called \"\"Imitations from the Modern Latin Poets\"\" and toured Wales with Joseph Hucks. Before they arrived at Wales, they visited Robert Allen at Oxford and met Robert Southey. Coleridge and Southey shared similar political views and the two bonded immediately. Eventually, both would leave college without attaining their degrees.\"',\n",
       " '238,Early career.',\n",
       " '239,\"Coleridge\\'s transition into being a Romantic poet began in 1794 when he began to focus on nature in his poetry. This was a direct influence from his relationship with Southey and the emotional connection that they shared as friends, and their friendship developed to the point of Coleridge no longer pursuing Mary Evans. The two encouraged each other to write poetry, with Coleridge adapting his 1791 poem \"\"Happiness\"\" for this purpose. They also encouraged each other in their liberal political beliefs and visited the British proponent of democracy Tom Poole in 1794. He encouraged the two towards Southey\\'s idea of Pantisocracy. Coleridge continued with his ideas of political reform and democracy, and, in 1795, he responded to the sedition trial of political activists Joseph Gerrald, Maurice Margarot, Thomas Muir, and Thomas Fyshe Palmer in a \"\"Moral and Political Lecture\"\" at Bristol. The lecture included a reading of Southey\\'s poem titled \"\"To the Exiled Patriots\"\" which condemns the trial.\"',\n",
       " '240,\"When Coleridge\\'s and Southey\\'s plan to create a Pantisocratic nation in the Americas during the summer of 1794, Coleridge determined to marry Sara Fricker, sister of Southey\\'s fiancée Edith Fricker. In order to fund the trip and the marriage, Coleridge was determined to have published his poetic-dramatic work, \"\"The Fall of Robespierre\"\". The closet drama was written partly by Coleridge, the first act, and partly by Southey, the second and third, and it describes the events of Robespierre\\'s final moments and his execution and that of 21 of his supporters along with denouncing tyranny. The work was published by Benjamin Flower and only under Coleridge\\'s name. When the summer ended, Coleridge left for London and began to spend time with his school friends, including Lamb. Soon after, he stopped his communication with Sara Fricker, which caused problems between him and Southey. Matters were compounded when Mary Evans wrote to Coleridge during Autumn 1794 after hearing of Coleridge\\'s and Southey\\'s Pantisocratic plans; she wanted him to reconsider the idea. This letter was followed by letters from his brother George which also asked him to reconsider.\"',\n",
       " '241,\"The letters affected Coleridge deeply and he visited George in November 1794. Coleridge still desired to be with Mary, but during the visit, he found out that Mary was engaged. After hearing the news, Coleridge determined that he was not in love with Sara Fricker. In December, he began to work on his poetry and befriended many of the liberal political activists in London. These new friends included William Godwin and Thomas Holcroft, two men that Coleridge agreed with politically but differed theologically. Coleridge would dispute with the two over religious questions, and Coleridge was able to boast of turning them from strong atheistic views. Coleridge, an admirer of Godwin and Godwin\\'s \"\"Political Justice\"\", dedicated a poem to Godwin as part of his poetry series called \"\"Sonnets on Eminent Characters\"\" that was published at the end of 1794 in the \"\"Morning Chronicle\"\". Of his other poetry, Coleridge wrote a poem about Christ\\'s nativity titled \"\"Religious Musings\"\", which was not published until 1796. Eventually, Southey grew tired of waiting for Coleridge to return from London and travelled to meet his friend in January 1795.\"',\n",
       " '242,\"When Southey and Coleridge met, they disputed over plans for their Pantisocracy; Southey wanted to travel to Wales to prepare and Coleridge wanted to work in London to earn money. Southey was able to convince Coleridge to return to Bristol and the two returned during January 1795. Soon after his arrival, Coleridge began talking to Sara Fricker again and returned to his plans of marrying her. He also befriended many political liberals, including the bookseller Joseph Cottle, the later publisher of Coleridge\\'s and Wordsworth\\'s \"\"Lyrical Ballads\"\". During this time, Coleridge began to raise money through lectures on politics, of which he gave three during February. His first lecture was called \"\"A Moral and Political Lecture\"\", given at the Bristol Corn Market, attacked the British government and William Pitt. The other two lectures were reworked to form a pamphlet entitled \"\"Conciones ad Populum. Or Addresses to the People\"\", published on 3 December 1795. In the pamphlet, Coleridge uses the image of the winter 1794 famine in asking for political changes. Coleridge continued to lecture during the year, giving one on 16 June on the topic of abolishing the slave trade and one on 26 November in opposition to the Gagging Acts. The November lecture was expanded into the pamphlet \"\"The Plot Discovered\"\", which was published in early December before the Gagging Acts were passed. Politics was not the only topic Coleridge lectured on in 1795; he gave \"\"Six Lectures on Revealed Religion\"\" during the spring that combined Unitarian religion and political ideas together.\"',\n",
       " '243,\"In August, Southey was offered by his uncle to travel together to Lisbon and afterwards to train as a lawyer. This upset Coleridge because he saw this as an act of betrayal and a destruction to their plans of Pantisocracy. There is no evidence that the two kept in contact for many months. During that time, Coleridge continued his engagement to Sara Fricker and wrote two poems to her, \"\"The Eolian Harp\"\", 20 August 1795, and \"\"Lines Written at Shurton Bars\"\", September 1795. He kept to his promise and married her on 4 October 1795. On 14 November, Southey married Edith with Coleridge writing a letter the day before stating that \"\"You are \"\"lost\"\" to \"\"me\"\", because you are lost to Virtue\"\". In the letter, Coleridge attacks Southey for causing the divide between the two of them and for pursuing money instead of their beliefs.\"',\n",
       " '244,\"Coleridge\\'s and Southey\\'s relationship dissolved, and Coleridge was without a close friend. However, he met William Wordsworth, a fellow poet, in September 1795 and would eventually become close with him. Their relationship did not yet start, and in January 1796 Coleridge was travelling to find subscribers for a proposed political magazine called \"\"The Watchman\"\". During this time, he met with Erasmus Darwin and discussed both politics and religion; Darwin\\'s atheism bothered Coleridge but he respected Darwin\\'s philosophical views. He returned in February and \"\"The Watchman\"\" was first published on 1 March 1796 with the purpose of attacking the Gagging Acts. It was printed every 8 days, and the second on 9 March attacked the practice of Church-led fasting. The paper was soon discontinued on 13 May when Coleridge ran out of money to print it. The lack of funds was compounded by illness in Sara\\'s family and the death of her brother-in-law. He was able to make money on the publication of \"\"Poems on Various Subjects\"\", 16 April 1796, and by giving lectures about Roman history.\"',\n",
       " '245,\"Coleridge\\'s \"\"Poems on Various Subjects\"\" was decently received and a second edition would be published in 1797 containing more poems. However, he lacked a steady income and began making plans on how to provide for his family. In May 1796, Coleridge resumed his friendship with Lamb after Lamb spent time in a madhouse. Also in May, a group of Coleridge\\'s friends decided to give a small income in return for their appreciation of his talents, but he still needed more. He took on the son of a rich Quaker, Charles Lloyd, as a boarder, which allowed him to provide for his family. While making the deal on 19 September 1796, he received word that his wife gave birth to their son, Hartley. Coleridge began making plans for moving to the countryside at Nether Stowey and did so, much to the displeasure of Lamb. Eventually, Wordsworth joined him along with visits from Poole, Lamb, and other associates. He partially mended his friendship with Southey and contributed verse to Southey\\'s \"\"Joan of Arc\"\" epic, lines later to be put together in the poem \"\"The Destiny of Nations\"\". In February 1797, Coleridge reviewed Matthew Lewis\\'s \"\"The Monk\"\" for the \"\"Critical Review\"\" and began writing \"\"Osorio\"\", a play requested by Sheridan for Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. While these works and others were being composed, Coleridge began to bond with Wordsworth, which started a close, poetic relationship that would influence both of their careers and inspire their greatest works.\"',\n",
       " '246,Pantisocracy.',\n",
       " '247,\"Coleridge and Southey came up with a theoretical political government named Pantisocracy. Originally named Pantocracy, the system was intended be a perfect, egalitarian society formed in America. Poole discussed their ideal government during their visit, and had hope for what the system would accomplish. However, Poole thought that the system would have little chance for succeeding, and he advised Coleridge and Southey that there would be problems regarding females and marriage contracts within the society. As plans were developed, they formed a group of people that would become part of the society, including Southey\\'s mother, Southey\\'s fiancée and her family, and a few others that they knew. Coleridge and Southey also encouraged the group to study agriculture and carpentry to help with the settlement.\"',\n",
       " '248,\"When locals heard of the group\\'s plans for starting a new society in the Americas, rumours were spread and criticism was lodged against Pantisocracy. This was compounded when Southey\\'s aunt, with whom he was living, found out about both the idea and Southey\\'s intention in marrying Edith Fricker, a person that his aunt felt was below his station. His aunt immediately stopped talking to him and kicked him out of her house. When Coleridge left for London, his thoughts about Pantisocracy began to change and he backed off his role in the matter. This was partly to blame for the intervention by Mary Evans and his brother George, and partly about Southey advocating for a master class and a servant class in their new society, all of which upset Coleridge. The idea did not completely collapse until Southey abandoned the plans in August 1795 in order to become a lawyer.\"',\n",
       " '249,Early works.',\n",
       " '250,\"Most of Coleridge\\'s juvenalia was posthumously published. Those written while he attended Christ\\'s Hospitals were imitations of conventional models of poetry during the late 18th-century. In particular, he focused on John Milton\\'s \"\"L\\'Allegro\"\", \"\"Il Penseroso\"\", and his \"\"Lycidas\"\", along with the poems of Collins, Gray, and Thomson. In terms of form, Coleridge relied on many abstract nouns that he would mark with capitalisation, and his nouns were constantly modified with a set of two adjectives. He did not start working with his own poetic form until 1794. Although they don\\'t provide a sense of where Coleridge developed his poetry later, the school-age poems do give insight into Coleridge\\'s thoughts and feelings during those years.\"',\n",
       " '251,\"When Thomas Middleton gave Coleridge an edition of William Lisle Bowles\\'s \"\"Sonnets\"\", he was inspired by the poems and even wrote a sonnet to Bowles in praise of the poems\\' language in 1794. Other poets, including William Cowper and his conversational poem, \"\"The Task\"\" (1785), also served as an influence in terms of how to compose diction within poetry. Coleridge explained his feelings about those that influenced him in a letter to John Thelwall written on 17 December 1796, \"\"But do not let us introduce an act of Uniformity against Poets\\xa0— I have room enough in \"\"my\"\" brain to admire, aye & almost equally, the \"\"head\"\" and fancy of Akenside, and the \"\"heart\"\" and fancy of Bowles, the solemn Lordliness of Milton, & the divine chit chat of Cowper.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '252,\"It was also in 1794 when Coleridge began to emphasize nature in his works and transitioned into a Romantic poet. During the summer of that year, he worked closely with Southey and co-wrote the political drama \"\"The Fall of Robespierre\"\", but it was not a success and lacked merit. However, his poetry took off after reading Schiller\\'s play, \"\"Robbers\"\", and composing a sonnet in response dedicated to Schiller during December near the time that he composed his sonnet to Bowles. The Bowles poem was included in the \"\"Sonnets on Eminent Characters\"\" series along with poems dedicated to Edmund Burke, Thomas Erskine, Godwin, Southey, Kosciusko, Pitt, Joseph Priestley, and Sheridan.\"',\n",
       " '253,\"Coleridge spent much of his time working on pamphlets and lecturing, especially on topics of political reform. He spoke often on liberal ideas and condemned practices such as slavery and movement within the British Parliament to expand sedition laws. When he spoke on religion, he emphasized Unitarianism and how it was a middle ground between the problems of Anglicanism and the problems of atheism. His religio-political views were influenced by the images found in the works of Spenser, Milton, and Bunyan, and his ideas were similar to those expounded by Priestley and David Harley. He especially disapproved notions of the Trinity and of Christian mysteries early on and instead substituted redemption without need for dogma. By 1805, he would change his views and become more Orthodox.\"',\n",

MacDowell\\'s mother died of a heart attack at the age of 53 after living sober for a year. When MacDowell was 8, her father remarried, this time to the former Mary Frances Stone. This union lasted until his death. MacDowell attended Winthrop University for two years before moving briefly to Columbia, South Carolina. After having been spotted by a representative from Wilhelmina Models while she was on a trip to Los Angeles, MacDowell signed a modeling contract with Elite Model Management in New York City in 1978.\"',\n",

A series of billboards in Times Square and national television commercials for Calvin Klein won attention and led to her 1984 film debut in \"\"\"\". In this role, MacDowell\\'s lines were dubbed by Glenn Close because her Southern accent was considered too pronounced for her role as Jane. In 1985, MacDowell filled a supporting role as a doctor in \"\"St. Elmo\\'s Fire\"\".\"',\n",
       " '396,\"MacDowell studied method acting with teachers from the Actors Studio in addition to working privately with the renowned coach Harold Guskin. Four years later, director Steven Soderbergh cast her in the independent film \"\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"\" (1989). Her performance earned her an Independent Spirit Award, a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, among others award nominations, which led to a series of starring roles in films such as \"\"Green Card\"\", \"\"The Object of Beauty\"\", and \"\"Short Cuts\"\". In the 1990s, MacDowell achieved stardom due to the box office success of director Harold Ramis\\'s 1993 comedy, \"\"Groundhog Day\"\", and \"\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\"\" (1994), opposite Hugh Grant.\"',\n",
       " '397,\"Since 1986, MacDowell has appeared in print and television advertisements for cosmetic and haircare company L\\'Oréal.

From 2013 to 2015, she starred in the Hallmark Channel family series \"\"Cedar Cove\"\". In 2018 MacDowell starred in and produced the Hallmark Hall of Fame film directed by Roger Spottiswoode based on the novel by Mary Alice Monroe, \"\"The Beach House\"\". Also in 2018, she was cast in the horror comedy film \"\"Ready or Not\"\", which was shot over 26 days. The film was released in 2019, and was a critical and commercial success. In 2019, she starred in the BBC sitcom \"\"Cuckoo\"\". In an episode of NBC\\'s \"\"Mr. Mayor\"\", that aired January 2021, MacDowell plays a fictionalized version of herself.\"',\n",

He is best known for designing and programming the Broderbund Apple II games \"\"Karateka\"\" and \"\"Prince of Persia\"\" in the 1980s, the latter of which grew into a multi-platform franchise.\"',\n",
       " '426,Early life.',\n",

       " '428,Career.',\n",
       " '429,\"While at Yale, Mechner wrote several Apple II games that he submitted for publication, but which were rejected. \"\"Asteroid Blaster\"\", an \"\"Asteroids\"\" clone, was submitted to Hayden Software and abstract arcade game \"\"Deathbounce\"\" to Broderbund. He then spent two years at Yale writing his first published game, \"\"Karateka\"\" (1984), which went to number one on the \"\"Billboard\"\" software chart.\"',\n",
       " '430,\"His second game, \"\"Prince of Persia\"\", was released in 1989 after more than three years of work. He wrote both games in 6502 assembly language for the Apple II, though that system was in decline through the late 1980s and little new software was released by 1989. Initially, \"\"Prince of Persia\"\" sold poorly; however, as it was ported to other systems, sales increased. Eventually, it was adapted for nearly every computer and console platform.\"',\n",
       " '431,\"Following the completion of \"\"Prince of Persia\"\", Mechner took several years off from the gaming industry, during which he attended film school, wrote an unproduced screenplay, and traveled Europe for two years.\"',\n",
       " '432,\"Mechner designed and directed the first sequel, \"\"\"\",released in 1993. By then, he was focused on game design and story mechanics and was no longer programming.\"',\n",

Smoking Car grew to sixty people, a huge game development team for the mid-1990s, and the game took longer to finish than anticipated. When finally released in 1997, it was positively reviewed but sold poorly. \"\"The Last Express\"\" was re-released in 2012 by French publisher DotEmu for mobile and other platforms.\"',\n",

       " '459,\"Bennett Lester Carter (August 8, 1907 – July 12, 2003) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, trumpeter, composer, arranger, and bandleader. With Johnny Hodges, he was a pioneer on the alto saxophone. From the beginning of his career in the 1920s he was a popular arranger, having written charts for Fletcher Henderson\\'s big band that shaped the swing style. He had an unusually long career that lasted into the 1990s. During the 1980s and \\'90s, he was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, which included receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award.\"',\n",
       " '460,Career.',\n",
       " '461,\"Born in New York City in 1907, he was given piano lessons by his mother and others in the neighborhood. He played trumpet and experimented briefly with C-melody saxophone before settling on alto saxophone. In the 1920s, he performed with June Clark, Billy Paige, and Earl Hines, then toured as a member of the Wilberforce Collegians led by Horace Henderson.\"',\n",
       " '462,\"He appeared on record for the first time in 1927 as a member of the Paradise Ten led by Charlie Johnson. He returned to the Collegians and became their bandleader through 1929, including a performance at the Savoy Ballroom in New York City.\"',\n",
       " '463,\"In his early 20s, Carter worked as arranger for Fletcher Henderson after that position was vacated by Don Redman. He had no formal education in arranging, so he learned by trial and error, getting on his knees and looking at the existing charts, \"\"writing the lead trumpet first and the lead saxophone first—which, of course, is the hard way. It was quite some time that I did that before I knew what a score was.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '464,\"He left Henderson to take Redman\\'s former job as leader of McKinney\\'s Cotton Pickers in Detroit. In 1932 he formed a band in New York City that included Chu Berry, Sid Catlett, Cozy Cole, Bill Coleman, Ben Webster, Dicky Wells, and Teddy Wilson. Carter\\'s arrangements were complex. Among the most significant were \"\"Keep a Song in Your Soul\"\", written for Henderson in 1930, and \"\"Lonesome Nights\"\" and \"\"Symphony in Riffs\"\" from 1933, both of which show Carter\\'s writing for saxophones.\"',\n",
       " '465,\"By the early 1930s, Carter and Johnny Hodges were considered the leading alto saxophonists. Carter also became a leading trumpet soloist, having rediscovered the instrument. He recorded extensively on trumpet in the 1930s. Carter\\'s short-lived Orchestra played the Harlem Club in New York but only recorded a handful of records for Columbia, OKeh and Vocalion. The OKeh sides were issued under the name The Chocolate Dandies.\"',\n",
       " '466,\"In 1933 Carter participated in sessions with British band leader Spike Hughes, who went to New York City to organize recordings with prominent African American musicians. These 14 sides plus four by Carter\\'s big band, titled at the time \"\"Spike Hughes and His Negro Orchestra\"\", were initially only issued in England. The musicians were from Carter\\'s band and included Red Allen, Dicky Wells, Wayman Carver, Coleman Hawkins, J. C. Higginbotham, and Chu Berry.\"',\n",
       " '467,\"Carter moved to London and spent two years as arranger for the BBC Big Band. In England, France, and Scandinavia he recorded with local musicians, and he took his band to the Netherlands. In these settings Carter played trumpet, clarinet, piano, alto and tenor saxophone, and provided occasional vocals. In 1938 he returned to America. He found regular work leading his band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem through 1941. The band included Shad Collins, Sidney De Paris, Vic Dickenson, and Freddie Webster. After this engagement he led a seven-piece band which included Eddie Barefield, Kenny Clarke, and Dizzy Gillespie.\"',\n",
       " '468,\"In the middle 1940s, he made Los Angeles his home, forming another big band, which at times included J. J. Johnson, Max Roach, and Miles Davis. But these would be his last big bands. With the exception of occasional concerts, performing with Jazz at the Philharmonic, and recording, he ceased working as a touring big band bandleader. Los Angeles provided him many opportunities for studio work, and these dominated his time during the decades. He wrote music and arrangements for television and films, such as \"\"Stormy Weather\"\" in 1943. During the 1950s and \\'60s, he wrote arrangements for vocalists such as Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, and Sarah Vaughan. On something of a comeback in the 1970s, Carter returned to playing saxophone again and toured the Middle East courtesy of the U.S. State Department. He began making annual visits to Europe and Japan.\"',\n",
       " '469,\"In 1969, Carter was persuaded to spend a weekend at Princeton University by Morroe Berger, a sociology professor at Princeton who wrote about jazz. This led to a new outlet for Carter\\'s talent: teaching. For the next nine years he visited Princeton five times, most of them brief stays except for one in 1973 when he spent a semester there as a visiting professor. In 1974 Princeton gave him an honorary doctorate. He conducted teaching at workshops and seminars at several other universities and was a visiting lecturer at Harvard for a week in 1987. Morroe Berger wrote \"\"Benny Carter – A Life in American Music\"\" (1982), a two-volume work about Carter\\'s career.\"',\n",
       " '470,\"Time had little effect on Carter\\'s abilities. During the 1980s he wrote the long composition \"\"Central City Sketches\"\" which was performed at Cooper Union by the American Jazz Orchestra. Another long composition, \"\"Glasgow Suite\"\", was performed in Scotland. Lincoln Center commission him to write \"\"Good Vibes\"\" in 1990. The National Endowment for the Arts gave him a grant that led \"\"Tales of the Rising Sun Suite\"\" and \"\"Harlem Renaissance Suite\"\". This music was performed in 1992 when he was 85 years old.\"',\n",
       " '471,\"Carter had an unusually long career. He was perhaps the only musician to have recorded in eight different decades. Another characteristic of his career was its versatility as musician, bandleader, arranger, and composer. He helped define the sound of alto saxophone, but he also performed and recorded on soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, and piano. He helped establish a foundation for arranging as far back as 1930 when he arranged \"\"Keep a Song in Your Soul\"\" for Fletcher Henderson\\'s big band. His compositions include the novelty hit \"\"Cow-Cow Boogie\"\" recorded by Ella Mae Morse, and the expansive \"\"Central City Sketches\"\", written when he was 80 years old and recorded with the American Jazz Orchestra.\"',\n",

In general, these type of programs focus primarily on characters between 13 and 19 years of age and routinely feature characters involved in humorous situations (either realistic or fantasy in style, depending on the program\\'s plotline), and often focus on the characters\\' family and social lives. The primary plot of each episode often involves the lead character(s) that the program centers on, while secondary plotlines often focus on the character(s\\') parents, siblings (those not among the leads, if any) or friends, although the secondary characters may sometimes also or instead be involved in the episode\\'s main plot.\"',\n",
       " '493,\"The most common episodic plot lines used in teen sitcoms involve the lead characters dealing with family and friends, ending up in a complicated situation (such as accepting two date invitations) that the characters must solve by episode\\'s end, getting into moral conflicts with their parents (or friends, relatives or siblings), and coming-of-age situations (such as a first date or learning how to drive); however, more dramatic and shocking plot elements or ones which center on undesirable (such as bullying, anxiety, peer pressure, dirty cops, excessive force, underage alcoholism, and possibly even substance abuse) may be featured as well, in what are sometimes called \"\"very special episodes\"\".\"',\n",

Such examples include \"\"Step by Step\"\" (which focused on a blended family and regularly focused on the exploits of the six younger characters), \"\"Boy Meets World\"\" (similar in format to \"\"The Wonder Years\"\", which ended before \"\"Boy Meets World\"\" debuted in 1993, both of which focused on a boy dealing with the challenges that come with growing into adolescence) and \"\"Family Matters\"\" (which originated as a family sitcom spun off from the family-friendly though adult-centered \"\"Perfect Strangers\"\", but soon shifted more of its focus towards its teenage characters due to the popularity of the character of nerdy high school (and later, college) student Steve Urkel).\"',\n",
       " '505,\"Other short-lived series that featured teenage protagonists included \"\"Sister, Sister\"\" (which aired during the 1994–1995 season but was cancelled and promptly moved to The WB and \"\"Clueless\"\" (aired during the 1996–1997 season but later moved to CBS; based on the hit 1995 comedy film starring teen idol Alicia Silverstone).\"',\n",
       " '506,\"One of the TGIF\\'s biggest hits was \"\"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\"\" which debuted in 1996. It starred Melissa Joan Hart whom was previously known to young audiences in the hit Nickelodeon teen sitcom \"\"Clarissa Explains It All\"\" which aired from 1991 to 1994. \"\"Sabrina\"\" was based on a popular Archie Comics character that was featured in an animated series from the early 1970s and a 1996 TV movie of the same name that aired on Showtime. The franchise focused on the adventures of the eponymous main character who tries to live a normal life as a teenager and later young adult while dealing with being a half-witch/half-mortal; \"\"Sabrina\"\" ran for four seasons on ABC and an additional three on The WB).\"',\n",
       " '507,\"Though TGIF was originally geared towards families, the success of \"\"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch\"\" and \"\"Boy Meets World\"\" which had its teenage cast become teen idols and the transfer of its more successful sitcoms like \"\"Step by Step\"\" and \"\"Family Matters\"\" (which by that point was more focused on the young adult cast) to CBS in 1997, led to the block\\'s shift towards teen-oriented sitcoms that fall. In order to capitalize on the success of \"\"Sabrina\"\", TGIF introduced two new fantasy comedies (albeit with male protagonists): \"\"Teen Angel\"\" (which heavily leaned towards a teenage demographic with its three male protagonists) and \"\"You Wish\"\" (which had more a family-oriented demographic). However, neither managed to find an audience and were cancelled after only a season.\"',\n",
       " '508,\"Another attempt at a teenage demographic came with the 1999 sitcom \"\"Odd Man Out\"\" which heavily promoted its teenage lead star Erik Von Detten (nicknamed \"\"EVD\"\") who was already popular with the teenage female audience from his previous roles in Disney media such as \"\"So Weird\"\" and \"\"Brink!\"\" and the Universal film \"\"Leave It to Beaver\"\". However like \"\"Teen Angel\"\", it failed to reach its intended audience and was cancelled after one season. Detten would later star in another short-lived \"\"TGIF\"\" sitcom, \"\"Complete Savages\"\" (2004-2005) which consisted of a predominately teenage male cast with a dysfunctional sibling dynamic a la \"\"Malcolm in the Middle\"\".\"',\n",
       " '509,\"Over time, the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) began shifting away from family-oriented comedies toward comedy series focused on adults (although some family comedies have continued to re-appear on those networks since then), teen sitcoms for the most part began to shift more towards broadcast networks intentionally aimed at younger audiences than the Big Three and cable television.\"',\n",
       " '510,NBC.',\n",
       " '511,\"In 1989, the sitcom \"\"Saved by the Bell\"\" (a retooling of the 1987–88 Disney Channel comedy \"\"Good Morning, Miss Bliss\"\") premiered on NBC. The series quickly became a fan favorite and one of the most highly rated and popular teen shows of all time. \"\"Saved by the Bell\"\" had its main characters go through typical teen issues and the drama of high school, though the series was very comical and the issues were often resolved before the end of the episode. Notably, \"\"Saved by the Bell\"\" featured teenage archetypes and stereotypes. \"\"Saved by the Bell\"\" kept its Saturday morning slot until 1993, when it ended after four seasons (by the final season, two main characters – Kelly Kapowski (Tiffani Thiessen) and Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkley) – departed from the series and were replaced by a new character).\"',\n",
       " '512,\"\"\"Saved by the Bell\"\" spawned a short-lived spin-off \\', which aired in primetime and only lasted one season; another spin-off, \\', lasted for seven years (although it was notable for reusing plotlines originating in episodes of the original \"\"Saved by the Bell\"\" series). The series was responsible for the creation of NBC\\'s TNBC Saturday morning block, which was targeted towards teenagers. The block also featured comedies such as \"\"California Dreams\"\" (focusing on an aspiring band), \"\"Hang Time\"\" (centering on the players and cheerleaders of a high school basketball team), \"\"City Guys\"\" (centering on the developing friendship of two New York City high school students of different backgrounds and races) and \"\"One World\"\" (focusing on a family in which all six children are adopted from different backgrounds). The vast majority of the series on the TNBC block were produced by Peter Engel.\"',\n",
       " '513,\"Fox, The WB and UPN.\"',\n",
       " '514,\"Fox, The WB and UPN were each launched (respectively in 1986 and 1995) with target audiences aimed at teenagers and adults between the ages of 12 and 34. Fox aired teen dramas such as \"\"Beverly Hills, 90210\"\" and \"\"Party of Five\"\" and sitcoms such as \"\"That \\'70s Show\"\", \"\"Malcolm in the Middle\"\", \"\"Married... with Children\"\" (in which its teen characters, who grew into adults over the 11-year run sometimes alternated between being part of the main plot and the secondary plot) and \"\"Parker Lewis Can\\'t Lose\"\".\"',\n",
       " '515,\"\"\"That \\'70s Show\"\" was a hit with both teenage and adult audiences, and focused on the lives of six teenage friends living in Wisconsin between 1976 and 1979; despite the short time period it was set in, the sitcom aired for eight years on Fox due to the use of a floating timeline. While \"\"Malcolm in the Middle\"\" was targeted towards an adult demographic, it featured a predominately adolescent-to-young adult male cast which led to its popularity with younger viewers and launched the career of teen idol Frankie Muniz.\"',\n",
       " '516,\"The WB and UPN were popular destinations for teen sitcoms. The WB\\'s earliest comedies with teens as the central characters included \"\"Sister, Sister\"\" (which originated on ABC from 1994 to 1999; about teenage twin sisters who accidentally reunite while at a clothing store with their respective adopted parents after being separated after they were born 15 years earlier, resulting in Tia Landry (Tia Mowry) and her mother Lisa (Jackée Harry) moving in the house belonging to Tamera Campbell (Tamera Mowry) and her father Ray (Tim Reid)) and \"\"Unhappily Ever After\"\" (originally centering on the divorcing parents of three children, but shifted its primary focus on the latter characters, specifically attractive but intelligent redhead Tiffany Malloy (Nikki Cox) and her less-than-bright brother Ryan (Kevin Connolly)).\"',\n",
       " '517,\"In 2002, \"\"What I Like About You\"\" debuted on The WB – centering on spontaneous, wild 16-year-old Holly Tyler (portrayed by former Nickelodeon star Amanda Bynes), who convinces her father – who accepts a job position in Japan – to let her live with her neurotic, uptight older sister Valerie (portrayed by former \"\"90210\"\" star Jennie Garth). In general, The WB put much of its programming focus during the network\\'s 11-year existence on teen-oriented series (attempting to broaden its audience in its final two years), which alongside comedy series had also included dramas such as \"\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"\" and \"\"One Tree Hill\"\".\"',\n",
       " '518,\"UPN\\'s sitcoms largely (with few exceptions) were aimed at African American audiences; such programs aimed at teens included \"\"Moesha\"\", which focused on African-American teenager Moesha Mitchell (portrayed by singer Brandy) and her family and friends. The 2001–06 sitcom \"\"One on One\"\", centered on Breanna Barnes (Kyla Pratt), who (in a relatively similar concept as \"\"What I Like About You\"\") convinces her mother to let her live with her father Flex Washington (Flex Alexander), a former basketball star who became a father to Breanna at age 18. Both The WB and UPN were shut down in September 2006, and were replaced by The CW (which carried series from both predecessor networks, including \"\"Everybody Hates Chris\"\", which was loosely based on the adolescence of actor/comedian Chris Rock). The CW dropped sitcoms from its schedule in 2009 (when \"\"Everybody Hates Chris\"\" and the adult-targeted dramedy \"\"The Game\"\" were canceled), to focus more on its drama and reality series.\"',\n",
       " '519,MTV.',\n",
       " '520,\"The creation of MTV in 1981 had gathered a majority of the teenage audience with the airing of back-to-back music videos. Over time (beginning in the early 1990s), MTV gradually shifted into its current format as a lifestyle and pop culture channel that airs a limited amount of music videos, mostly during the late night and early morning hours, instead focusing on reality shows, soap operas, sports, documentaries and music-related programs.\"',\n",
       " '521,\"MTV aired series targeted towards teenagers such as \"\"TRL\"\", a daily music countdown show; \"\"\"\", a reality show focused around a group or rich teenagers living in California; and the latter\\'s spinoff \"\"The Hills\"\", which centered on former \"\"Laguna Beach\"\" cast member Lauren Conrad and her internship at \"\"Teen Vogue\"\". During the 1990s, MTV aired the controversial animated series \"\"Beavis and Butt-head\"\", which focused on the antics of two idiotic teenage slackers and their unsuccessful attempts at getting girls, though they often displayed gross, violent and crude behavior; a spinoff about one of the lead characters\\' former classmates, \"\"Daria\"\", premiered in 1997 and focused around a cynical, sarcastic, intelligent yet monotone teenage girl and her stereotype-infested high school. In 2010, MTV premiered its first live action teen sitcom \"\"The Hard Times of RJ Berger\"\", which became an instant hit although it would be canceled after two seasons. \"\"Awkward\"\", which debuted in 2011, was another hit for the network and focuses on a teenage girl who tries to navigate through adolescence after the circumstances of a bathroom accident after reading an anonymous letter written about her, result in her notoriety once her high school classmates believe she attempted suicide.\"',\n",
       " '522,Nickelodeon.',\n",
       " '523,\"Children\\'s cable channel Nickelodeon had begun its own trend of producing teen sitcoms in the late 1980s; one of the earliest was the 1989–93 series \"\"Hey Dude\"\", which focused on a group of teenagers working at a dude ranch; the network\\'s most popular comedy of the 1990s was \"\"Clarissa Explains It All\"\", running from 1991 to 1994 and starring then-unknown actress Melissa Joan Hart, which focused around Clarissa Darling, a typical teenager that faced typical teen issues and an aggravating younger brother. The series debunked a long-held belief that a children\\'s series that centered on a female character would not be popular with boys, in fact, \"\"Clarissa\"\" was universally popular among children of both genders (Hart would later star in the hit sitcom \"\"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\"\" which further would catapult her further into teen stardom).\"',\n",
       " '524,\"In the same year as \"\"Clarissa\"\", Nickelodeon also premiered \"\"Salute Your Shorts\"\", a sitcom following the various hijinks of teenage campers at Camp Anawanna and \"\"Welcome Freshmen\"\", a subversive take on the high school sitcom which featured a mix of comedy skits, a glaring lack of educational and moral lessons, sexual innuendo and cynical main characters. However, neither managed to reach the success of \"\"Clarissa\"\" which outlived both series by a year. The year 1992 saw the introduction of the network\\'s popular long-running primetime block SNICK (contraction of Saturday Night Nick) and the network\\'s first in-house sketch comedy/variety series \"\"Roundhouse\"\". While not hugely successful in the ratings, Roundhouse still was innovative in some ways such as featuring a large diverse teenage cast and an urban setting which stood out from the predominately white suburban environment of the Nickelodeon\\'s previous series.\"',\n",
       " '525,\"From 1993 to 1994, Nickelodeon aired \"\"The Adventures of Pete & Pete\"\" (which grew to have a strong cult following over the years), \"\"The Secret World of Alex Mack\"\" (a female driven series like \"\"Clarissa\"\" which was also a success, having a four-year run) and the short-lived \"\"My Brother and Me\"\" (which serves as a milestone as Nick\\'s first black sitcom). The year 1994 marked the premiere of highly successful sketch comedy series \"\"All That\"\" which highlighted a multiracial cast similar to its predecessor \"\"Roundhouse\"\" but unlike its predecessor, \"\"All That\"\" enjoyed a decade of popularity ending its long run in 2005. \"\"All That\"\" was also a crucial starting point of Dan Schneider\\'s relationship with Nickelodeon and started the careers of several successful teen actors associated with Nickelodeon\\'s brand.\"',\n",
       " '526,\"In 1996, Nickelodeon debuted \"\"Kenan & Kel\"\" (the first spin-off of \"\"All That\"\" which became a hit sitcom for the network), in 1998, \"\"Cousin Skeeter\"\", and in 1999, \"\"The Amanda Show\"\" (the second spin-off of \"\"All That\"\" which remains one of Nickelodeon\\'s highest rated series and launched the career of teen idol Amanda Bynes) and \"\"100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd\"\".\"',\n",
       " '527,\"From the 2000s onward, Nickelodeon has aired \"\"The Brothers Garcia\"\", \"\"Noah Knows Best\"\", \"\"As Told by Ginger\"\", \"\"The Nick Cannon Show\"\" (spun-off from \"\"All That\"\"), \"\"Taina\"\" (a predecessor to \"\"Victorious\"\"), \"\"Drake & Josh\"\" (spun-off from \"\"The Amanda Show\"\"), \"\"Romeo!\"\", \"\"Unfabulous\"\", \"\"Ned\\'s Declassified School Survival Guide\"\", \"\"Zoey 101\"\" (spun-off from \"\"All That\"\"), \"\"Just Jordan\"\", \"\"iCarly\"\" (spun-off from \"\"Drake & Josh\"\" and grew to become one of longest-running and the highest rated live-action series in Nickelodeon history), \"\"True Jackson, VP\"\", \"\"Big Time Rush\"\", \"\"The Troop\"\", \"\"Bucket & Skinner\\'s Epic Adventures\"\", \"\"How to Rock\"\", \"\"Victorious\"\" (spun-off from \"\"Zoey 101\"\" and served as the launching pad for pop star Ariana Grande\\'s career), \"\"Sam & Cat\"\" (spun-off from \"\"iCarly\"\" and \"\"Victorious\"\"), \"\"Supah Ninjas\"\", \"\"The Thundermans\"\", \"\"Every Witch Way\"\", \"\"Bella and the Bulldogs\"\", \"\"Henry Danger\"\" \"\"Nicky Ricky Dicky and Dawn and \"\"Talia in the Kitchen\"\", all of which are targeted towards older children and teenagers along with adults.\"',\n",
       " '528,\"Its teen comedies, as well as animated and dramatic series, populated the long-running SNICK block that ran from 1992 to 2005; SNICK was replaced by TEENick as the network\\'s block for teen comedy in 2002, the same year which Nickelodeon launched The N (as an evening program block on Noggin, it has since been spun off into a separate cable channel that is now known as TeenNick), which is devoted to airing teen sitcoms (outside of the network\\'s nighttime block).\"',\n",
       " '529,Disney Channel.',\n",
       " '530,\"Launched in 1983, Disney Channel was originally a premium channel geared towards young children, families and adults. However, in 1988, the channel made its first attempt to appeal to an adolescent audience with its first original sitcom \"\"Good Morning, Miss Bliss\"\". \"\"Miss Bliss\"\" detailed the lives of middle schoolers who got into various wacky adventures but had the guidance of their kind-hearted homeroom teacher Miss Bliss (portrayed by former Disney teen idol Hayley Mills). It was short-lived and was retooled later into NBC\\'s \"\"Saved by the Bell\"\" which enjoyed much more success on the broadcast network and syndication.\"',\n",
       " '531,\"Another attempt came with 1989 reboot of \"\"The Mickey Mouse Club (MMC)\"\" which contained a mix of sketch comedy, musical and dance numbers (often covers of then-popular pop songs), celebrity guest stars and serial dramas. As opposed to its counterpart \"\"Kids Incorporated\"\" (also airing on Disney Channel) which was aimed squarely at children, \"\"MMC\"\"\\'s demographic skewed towards older children and teenagers. It was not only a huge success for the premium channel but served as a testing ground for the channel\\'s earliest attempts at creating a brand of teen pop stars. Two pop groups were spawned from the variety show: The Party and MMC, both contained the most popular cast members at the time. A few years after \"\"MMC\"\" ended, a handful of former cast members would go on to have successful careers in music and film including: Britney Spears, Ryan Gosling, Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez (who both became members of the popular boy band *NSYNC), Christina Aguilera and Keri Russell.\"',\n",
       " '532,\"During the 90s and 2000s, Disney Channel would begin to air reruns of teen-themed comedies and dramas such as \"\"Eerie, Indiana\"\", \"\"The Baby-Sitters Club\"\", \"\"Ready or Not\"\", \"\"The Torkelsons\"\", \"\"Growing Pains\"\", \"\"Brotherly Love\"\", \"\"Smart Guy\"\", \"\"Ocean Girl\"\", \"\"Dinosaurs\"\", \"\"\"\", \"\"Boy Meets World\"\", \"\"Sister, Sister\"\", \"\"Life with Derek\"\" and \"\"Naturally, Sadie\"\".\"',\n",
       " '533,\"In 1997, Disney Channel began the transition into the basic cable market (which was completed nationwide by 2002) and underwent a network overhaul. This overhaul involved the network shifting its main focus to \"\"tweens\"\" and young teenagers which culminated in the 1998 launch of the \"\"Zoog Disney\"\" brand. \"\"Zoog Disney\"\" was a primetime and weekend block hosted by animated teenage cyber-creatures called \"\"Zoogs\"\" and featured original series and films, live concerts and music videos of current teen pop artists, exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of upcoming Disney films, extreme sports clips and interstitials that promoted usage of the internet. These new original series included: \"\"Flash Forward\"\" (a coming-of-age comedy about two best friends in their last year of middle school), \"\"The Jersey\"\" (a sports-themed comedy about a magical jersey that places its teenage protagonists into the bodies of famous athletes), \"\"The Famous Jett Jackson\"\" (a dramedy about the star of an action television action series trying to balance life as a normal teenager), \"\"Bug Juice\"\" (a reality show about the adventures of teenagers at summer camp) and \"\"So Weird\"\" (a dramatic sci-fi series focusing around a teenage girl who attracts the paranormal/occult and often has to battle potential threats to humanity, despite the darker tone of its previous seasons, the final season was re-tooled to have a lighter tone and highlighted the musical talents of the new protagonist).\"',\n",
       " '534,\"Disney Channel\\'s first truly successful sitcom was \"\"Even Stevens\"\", centering on the sibling rivalry between lead characters Ren and Louis Stevens; it was followed one year later (in 2001) by \"\"Lizzie McGuire\"\", which centered on a junior high school girl dealing with the onset of puberty, trying to become popular and other teen issues, and topped \"\"Even Stevens\"\" in popularity among viewers. \"\"That\\'s So Raven\"\", which mixed fantasy and real-life issues (centering on a girl who has psychic abilities that are only known by her friends and family), also became a major hit for Disney Channel; it was also the first Disney Channel series both to last four seasons and to reach 100 episodes.\"',\n",
       " '535,\"\"\"That\\'s So Raven\"\" ultimately led to more \"\"high concept\"\" series to be produced for the channel, the most notable of which include \"\"Hannah Montana\"\" (centering on a girl who, until the series\\' fourth and last season, led a secret double life as a teen pop star; the series surpassed its predecessors in terms of popularity), \"\"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\"\" (centering on twin brothers living in a hotel where their mother works as a singer and a smart blonde and a dumb Asian live here; it led to a spin-off set on a cruise ship featuring the majority of the original series\\' main cast, \"\"The Suite Life on Deck\"\") and \"\"Wizards of Waverly Place\"\" (which surpassed \"\"That\\'s So Raven\"\" as the longest-running Disney Channel series by number of episodes, ending its run with 106 episodes, and centered on three siblings vying to become the sole wizard of their family). The channel continues to produce comedies with a \"\"high concept\"\" plot, such as \"\"Jessie\"\" (centering on a Texan woman who becomes a nanny to four upper-class New York City children), \"\"Shake It Up\"\" (about two teenage girls who are dancers on a local music show), \"\"A.N.T. Farm\"\" (about middle school students transferred into a gifted high school education program), \"\"Austin & Ally\"\" (about a teen pop singer\\'s relationship with a teenage songwriter) and \"\"Dog With a Blog\"\" (about a family whose pet dog is able to talk). However, shows with a more basic plotline are also featured such as \"\"Good Luck Charlie\"\" (centering on the Duncan Family adjusting to the recent arrival of a new baby), \"\"Liv and Maddie\"\" (focusing on teenage twin sisters, one of whom is a former sitcom star, adjusting to life together in the same high school And Focus on The Rooney Family), \"\"I Didn\\'t Do It\"\" (which outlines an incident involving the two lead characters each episode as explained by them), and \"\"Girl Meets World\"\" (which focuses on \"\"Boy Meets World\"\" characters, Cory and Topanga Matthews\\' teenage daughter, Riley as she navigates the challenges of life and being a teenager) which are all fairly popular with teenage audiences, as well as older children and young adults.\"',\n",
       " '536,\"Disney Channel\\'s comedy series, while not exclusively targeted for that audience, are geared more towards teen and preteen girls; in contrast, the channel\\'s male-oriented spin-off network Disney XD, features series aimed at boys, although shows on each network are universally popular among both genders.

You literally don\\'t breathe in the same way that you do when you\\'re playing the classics. When you have to deliver those long, complex speeches on stage, you can\\'t heave your shoulders after every sentence. The set of muscles required for that kind of acting need to be trained. I really wanted to try and do justice to my own potential in the parts. I didn\\'t want to be a movie actor just dropping in, doing Hamlet and taking off again.

       " '770,\"William Wordsworth (7 April 1770 – 23 April 1850) was an English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their 1798 joint publication, \"\"Lyrical Ballads\"\". His early years were dominated by his experience of the countryside around the Lake District and the English moors. Dorothy Wordsworth, his sister, served as his early companion until their mother\\'s death and their separation when he was sent to school.\"',\n",
       " '771,Parents.',\n",
       " '772,\"Wordsworth\\'s parents were John Wordsworth, a legal agent for James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and Collector of Customs at Whitehaven, and his wife, Ann Cookson. John was the son of Richard Wordsworth, a land owner who served as a legal agent to the Lowther family.\"',\n",
       " '773,\"Like his father, John became a legal agent for James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and was made Bailiff and Recorder for Cockermouth and Coroner for the Seigniory of Millom.\"',\n",
       " '774,\"Ann was the daughter of William Cookson, a linen-draper, and Dorothy Crackanthorpe, daughter of a gentry family in Westmorland. They lived above Cookson\\'s shop in Penrith, Cumbria. Ann\\'s brother, Christopher \"\"Kit\"\" Crackanthorpe Cookson (later, Christopher Crackanthorpe) inherited the family estate of Newbiggin Hall.\"',\n",
       " '775,\"John, at the age of 26, married Ann, 18, in 1766, and he used his connections with the Lowther family to move into a large mansion in the small town of Cockermouth, Cumbria, in the Lake District. John owned many properties, in Cockermouth and Ravenglass, and he inherited a property at Sockbridge, which was originally purchased by his father and given to John after his older brother, Richard, was disinherited by their father. However, the brother\\'s relationship was not strained by this decision, and Richard would become guardian to John\\'s children after his death.\"',\n",
       " \"776,William's mother died when he was 7 years old and he became an orphan at the age of 13 years.\",\n",
       " '777,Childhood.',\n",
       " '778,\"Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in Cockermouth, the second of five children. His sister, the poet, and diarist Dorothy, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptized together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who would become a poet and enjoy nature with William and Dorothy until he died in an 1805 shipwreck; and Christopher, the youngest, who would become a scholar and eventually Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. Although he lived at his father\\'s mansion, Wordsworth, as with his siblings, had little involvement with their father, and they would be distant with him until his death in 1783.\"',\n",
       " '779,\"Wordsworth\\'s father, although rarely present, did teach him poetry, including that of Milton, Shakespeare, and Spenser, in addition to allowing his son to rely on his father\\'s library. In addition to spending his time reading in Cockermouth, he would stay at his mother\\'s parents home in Penrith, for extended periods of time, which took place primarily during 1775–1776 and during the winter months of 1776–1777. At Penrith, Wordsworth was exposed to the moors and was influenced by his experience with the landscape and was further turned towards nature by the harsh treatment he received at the hands of his relatives. In particular, Wordsworth could not get along with his grandparents and his uncle, and his hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.\"',\n",
       " '780,\"In March 1778, Ann died of an illness, possibly pneumonia, at Penrith. After the death of his mother in 1778, his father was inconsolable and sent his children away to be raised by their relatives. William was taken in by his mother\\'s family and eventually sent to Hawkshead Grammar School, and Dorothy was sent to live with Elizabeth Threlkeld, Ann\\'s cousin, in Halifax. She and William did not meet again for another nine years. Although Hawkshead was Wordsworth\\'s first serious experience with education, he was taught to read by his mother and attended a tiny school in Cockermouth of low quality.\"',\n",
       " '781,Education and nature.',\n",
       " '782,\"At Penrith, Wordsworth was sent to a school for the children of upper-class families and taught by Ann Birkett, a woman who insisted in instilling tradition in her students that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day, or Shrove Tide. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the \"\"Spectator\"\", but little else. It was at the school that Wordsworth was to meet the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who would be his future wife. Life at Penrith wasn\\'t a happy time for Wordsworth, because he was unsatisfied with his grandparents\\' treatment; he still spent time at his grandparents\\' home and their relationship was still tense. Wordsworth became rebellious to the point of destroying a family portrait.\"',\n",
       " '783,\"His discontent with his familial situation provoked Wordsworth to spend his time wandering away from his home, an action Wordsworth relates as uniting a childish imagination with both nature and mankind in \"\"The Prelude\"\". He became attached to nature, and, when he was finally sent to school in Hawkshead, he was able to fully enjoy the countryside.\"',\n",
       " '784,\"Besides the local surroundings, Wordsworth was educated at the Hawkshead Grammar School, which had a reputation for scholarship and preparation for University entrance.\"',\n",
       " '785,\"A large portion of Wordsworth\\'s education at Hawkshead was based on mathematics. The rest of the curriculum was based on teaching the classics, and it was during his classical studies that Wordsworth gained a love for Latin literature. Besides his literary education, Wordsworth and his brothers were given dancing lessons in 1785. While Wordsworth was taught at Hawkshead, he boarded with Hugh and Ann Tyson in the nearby hamlet of Colthouse, where he was exposed to the local yarn trade. The community had a strong Quaker influence, and Wordsworth, after experiencing their traditions, rejected their fixation on praising God for a relationship with the divine that would involve a more direct interaction.\"',\n",
       " '786,College.',\n",
       " '787,\"Hawkshead School had a strong relationship with St.John\\'s College at Cambridge University and, in October 1787, Wordsworth became an undergraduate there.\"',\n",
       " '788,Early career.',\n",
       " '789,\"Wordsworth felt that his life before Samuel Taylor Coleridge was sedentary and dull and his poetry amounted to little. When Coleridge was near, he was Wordsworth\\'s muse, and Coleridge\\'s praise and encouragement kept Wordsworth motivated. Dorothy described Wordsworth while around Coleridge when she wrote: \"\"His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did\"\". It was under Coleridge\\'s support that Wordsworth was encouraged to write poetry intended to rival Milton.\"',\n",
       " '790,\"William Wordsworth,one of the pioneers of the Romantic movement in English poetry,was deeply influenced by the French revolution which broke out in 1789.The spirit of revolution popularly summarised as \"\"liberty,equality,fraternity informed the romantic elements in his poetry.His friendship with S.T.Coleridge led to joint literary venture in the form of publication of The Lyrical Ballads in 1798.\"',\n",
       " '791,\"When Wordsworth was forced to move from Alfoxden, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy agreed to travel to Germany in September 1798. Originally, Coleridge and Wordsworth lived together in Hamburg, until Coleridge decided to look for a place to live at Ratzeburg. Wordsworth wanted to join his friend, but was forced to decline over monetary issues; Wordsworth was unable to provide for both himself and his sister in such an expensive town, and they instead moved to Goslar. The separation, with the expenses, made it impossible for Wordsworth to spend time with Coleridge until after the winter of 1798.\"',\n",
       " '792,\"Wordsworth continued to write even without the support of Coleridge\\'s company, and from October 1798 to February 1799 Wordsworth began writing the \"\"Matthew\"\" poems along with the \"\"Lucy\"\" poems and other poems. These poems express the frustration and anxiety that Wordsworth was feeling In particular, it is possible that the \"\"Lucy\"\" poems allowed Wordsworth to vent his frustration with his sister, and that they contain the subconscious desire for his sister to die. The two poems are thematically unique compared to Wordsworth\\'s other poems, especially in their portrayal of loss and a lack of faith that nature is able to provide comfort or solutions to life\\'s problems. This reversal of Wordsworth\\'s view of nature provoked Alan Grob to suggest that the two sets of poems should be known \"\"as the Goslar lyrics of 1799\"\".\"',\n",
       " '793,Early works.',\n",
       " '794,\"Besides an emphasis on nature, as Bennett Weaver points out, \"\"The dominant theme of the poems of 1799 is death: death for the children of the village school, for Matthew\\'s daughter, and for Lucy Gray.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '795,Lyrical Ballads.',\n",
       " '796,\"In his \"\"Preface to Lyrical Ballads\"\", which is called the \"\"manifesto\"\" of English Romantic criticism, Wordsworth calls his poems \"\"experimental\"\". The year 1793 saw Wordsworth\\'s first published poetry, with the collections \"\"An Evening Walk\"\" and \"\"Descriptive Sketches\"\". He received a legacy of £900 from Raisley Calvert in 1795 so that he could pursue writing poetry. That year, he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. In 1797, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge\\'s home in Nether Stowey. Together, Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced \"\"Lyrical Ballads\"\" (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth\\'s nor Coleridge\\'s name as author. One of Wordsworth\\'s most famous poems, \"\"Tintern Abbey\"\", was published in the work, along with Coleridge\\'s \"\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"\". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author, and included a preface to the poems, which was augmented significantly in the 1802 edition. This Preface to Lyrical Ballads is considered a central work of Romantic literary theory. In it, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of poetry, one based on the \"\"real language of men\"\" and which avoids the poetic diction of much 18th-century poetry. Here, Wordsworth gives his famous definition of poetry as \"\"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.\"\" A fourth and final edition of Lyrical Ballads was published in 1805.\"',\n",
       " '797,Prelude.',\n",
       " '798,\"In 1799, Wordsworth completed a version of his \"\"Prelude\"\", which was, according to Stephen Gill, \"\"the most sustained self-examination in English poetry\"\". In Wordsworth\\'s 1799 \"\"Prelude\"\", he attempted to write a biography about the growth of his mind from childhood to the current time. However, he realized that this could never be complete and wrote:\"',\n",
       " '799,\"The 1799 \"\"Prelude\"\" describes Wordsworth\\'s early, happy moments in Cockermouth with a particular focus on the River Derwent and Cockermouth Castle. The poem transitions into the happy moments at Hawkshead, skipping over Wordsworth\\'s experience with his mother\\'s family, and only one scene containing his experience in Penrith was introduced in Book XII of the 1805 edition.\"',\n",

His father\\'s heritage originates with German immigrants to North Carolina in the 1700s, and Costner also has English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. Costner was raised Baptist. He was not academically inclined in school. He enjoyed sports (especially football), took piano lessons, wrote poetry, and sang in the First Baptist Choir. He has stated that a viewing of the 1963 film \"\"How the West Was Won\"\" at the age of seven had \"\"formed\"\" his childhood.\"',\n",
       " '809,\"He has described spending his teenage years in different parts of California as his father\\'s career progressed, as a period when he \"\"lost a lot of confidence\"\", having to make new friends often. Costner lived in Ventura, then in Visalia; he moved to Orange County and attended Mt. Whitney High School where he was in the marching band. He graduated from Villa Park High School in 1973. He earned a BA in marketing and finance from California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 1978. While at CSUF, he became a brother in the Delta Chi fraternity.\"',\n",
       " '810,\"Costner became interested in acting and dancing while in his last year of college, and upon graduation, he married Cindy Silva, who worked at Disneyland as Cinderella. The couple honeymooned in Puerto Vallarta; on the return plane journey, they had a chance encounter with actor Richard Burton, who had purchased all the seats around him for solitude. Burton agreed to speak to Costner after he finished reading his book. Costner, who had been taking acting classes but had not told his wife about his desire to be an actor, watched Burton closely and approached when Burton gestured. Costner told Burton that he would prefer to avoid the drama that followed Burton and asked if he would have to tolerate that if he became an actor. Burton replied, \"\"You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes. I think you\\'ll be fine.\"\" After the plane landed, Burton\\'s limousine pulled up to the curb where Costner and his wife were waiting for a taxi. Burton wished Costner good luck, and the two never met again. Costner credits Burton with partially contributing to his career.\"',\n",
       " '811,\"Having agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive, Costner began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his wife. His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars\\' Hollywood homes to support the couple while he also attended auditions.\"',\n",
       " '812,Career.',\n",
       " '813,\"Costner made his film debut in the film \"\"Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.\"\" (known originally as \"\"Hot Malibu Summer\"\"). Filmed in the winter of 1978–79, the film was not released until 1981 and re-released in 1986. The release complications and lack of documentation lead many to believe that Costner\\'s debut was in \"\"The Touch\"\" (also known as \"\"Stacy\\'s Knights\"\"), in 1983 with Eve Lilith and Andra Millian. Costner made a brief appearance in the Ron Howard film \"\"Night Shift\"\" (1982). He is listed in the credits as \\'Frat Boy No.\\xa01\\' and appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler. Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden halt of celebration.\"',\n",
       " '814,\"Costner appeared in a commercial for the Apple Lisa and \"\"Table for Five\"\" in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the nuclear holocaust film \"\"Testament\"\". Later, he was cast in \"\"The Big Chill\"\" and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut. His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together. Costner was a friend of director Lawrence Kasdan, who promised the actor a role in a future project. That became \"\"Silverado\"\" (1985) and a breakout role for Costner. He also starred that year in the smaller films \"\"Fandango\"\" and \"\"American Flyers\"\" and appeared alongside Kiefer Sutherland in an hour-long special episode of Steven Spielberg\\'s \"\"Amazing Stories\"\".\"',\n",
       " '815,\"Costner achieved movie star status in 1987, when he starred as federal agent Eliot Ness in \"\"The Untouchables\"\" and in the leading role of the thriller \"\"No Way Out\"\". He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films \"\"Bull Durham\"\" (1988) and \"\"Field of Dreams\"\" (1989). In 1990, he partnered with producer Jim Wilson to form the production company Tig Productions. Tig\\'s first film was the epic \"\"Dances with Wolves\"\" which Costner directed and starred in. This film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including two for him personally (Best Picture and Best Director). The same year saw the release of \"\"Revenge\"\", in which he starred along with Anthony Quinn and Madeleine Stowe, directed by Tony Scott; Costner had wanted to direct it himself.\"',\n",
       " '816,\"Costner followed with \"\"\"\" (1991); the Oliver Stone-directed \"\"JFK\"\" (1991); \"\"The Bodyguard\"\" (1992); and Clint Eastwood\\'s \"\"A Perfect World\"\" (1993); all of which provided box office or critical acclaim. He took the title role in the biopic \"\"Wyatt Earp\"\" (1994), directed by Kasdan. \"\"The War\"\", also made in 1994, seemed to gain little attention. The science fiction-post-apocalyptic epics \"\"Waterworld\"\" (1995) and \"\"The Postman\"\" (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures. However, while \"\"Waterworld\"\" achieved respectable box office and some positive reviews, results for \"\"The Postman\"\" were far worse and it ended up \"\"winning\"\" five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner. Costner starred in the golf comedy \"\"Tin Cup\"\" (1996) for Ron Shelton, who had previously directed him in \"\"Bull Durham\"\". He developed the film \"\"Air Force One\"\" and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing \"\"The Postman\"\" instead. He personally offered the project to Harrison Ford. In 1999, he starred in \"\"Message in a Bottle \"\" with Robin Wright, based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The film drew mixed reviews and just about broke even at the box office.\"',\n",
       " '817,\"His career revived somewhat in 2000 with \"\"Thirteen Days\"\", in which he portrayed Kenneth O\\'Donnell, a top adviser to John F. Kennedy. The western \"\"Open Range\"\", which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired professional baseball player Denny Davies in \"\"The Upside of Anger\"\", for which he received a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association and won the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. After that, Costner starred in \"\"The Guardian\"\" and in \"\"Mr. Brooks\"\", in which he portrayed a serial killer. In 2008, his Tig Productions company closed and was changed to Tree House Films. In 2008, Costner starred in \"\"Swing Vote\"\". He starred opposite Jennifer Aniston in the 2005 movie \"\"Rumour Has It\"\". Costner was honored on September 6, 2006, when his hand and foot prints were set in concrete in front of Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre alongside those of other celebrated actors and entertainers. In 2010, he appeared in \"\"The Company Men\"\" alongside Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, and received good reviews. It was released in cinemas worldwide in January 2011. The film was considered to be an Oscar contender, but did not get a nomination.\"',\n",
       " '818,\"Costner announced that he would be returning to the director\\'s chair for the first time in seven years, in 2011, with \"\"A Little War of Our Own\"\". He was also about to team up again with director Kevin Reynolds in \"\"Learning Italian\"\". Neither film has been made .\"',\n",
       " '819,\"He also appears, as a special cameo, in \"\"Funny or Die\"\" \"\"Field of Dreams 2: NFL Lockout\"\". Costner portrayed Jonathan Kent in the rebooted Superman film \"\"Man of Steel\"\", directed by Zack Snyder. Costner was going to have a role in Quentin Tarantino\\'s \"\"Django Unchained\"\", but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts.\"',\n",
       " '820,\"Costner starred in the three-part miniseries \"\"Hatfields & McCoys\"\", which premiered on May 28, 2012, on the History Channel. It broke a record by pulling 13.9\\xa0million viewers. The miniseries tells the true American story of a legendary family feud – one that spanned decades and nearly launched a war between Kentucky and West Virginia. The role earned Costner the 2012 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie, the 2013 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie, and the 2013 Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Limited Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television.\"',\n",
       " '821,\"In 2014, Costner appeared in the spy movie \"\"\"\", as Thomas Harper, a mentor for the series\\' title character. The same year, he starred in the thriller \"\"3 Days to Kill\"\" and the drama \"\"Draft Day\"\" and produced and starred in \"\"Black or White\"\". \"\"Black or White\"\" premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and opened in the United States in 2015. In 2015, Costner played coach Jim White in the drama film \"\"McFarland, USA\"\", about cross-country running. In 2016, he played the fictional character Al Harrison, a NASA Space Task Group supervisor, in \"\"Hidden Figures\"\", and in 2017, he starred with Jessica Chastain in Aaron Sorkin\\'s directorial debut film \"\"Molly\\'s Game\"\". In 2018, he has appeared in the television series \"\"Yellowstone\"\", marking the first regular TV series role of his career.\"',\n",
       " '822,\"In 2019, Costner starred in \"\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\"\", where he voiced Enzo the dog. It was his first voice-over film in his career.\"',\n",

       " '825,\"Costner is the singer in Kevin Costner & Modern West, a country rock band which he founded with the encouragement of his wife Christine. In October 2007, they began a worldwide tour which included shows in Istanbul and Rome. The group also performed at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races at Daytona International Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina.\"',\n",
       " '826,\"The band released a country album, \"\"Untold Truths\"\", on November 11, 2008, on Universal South Records. The album peaked at No.\\xa061 on the \"\"Billboard\"\" Top Country Albums and No.\\xa035 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Three singles (\"\"Superman 14\"\", \"\"Long Hot Night\"\" and \"\"Backyard\"\") have been released to radio, although none have charted. For the single \"\"Superman 14\"\" a live music video was made.\"',\n",
       " '827,\"In 2009, they went on tour with opening act The Alternate Routes. In August, at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose, Alberta, Costner and the band were scheduled next on stage when a severe thunderstorm struck, causing the stage and stands on the main stage to collapse. One person was reported dead and forty injured. Later, an auction was held to raise money for the two young sons of the woman killed. A dinner with Costner was auctioned off for $41,000. Two guitars, one autographed by Costner, helped raise another $10,000 each.\"',\n",
       " '828,\"A second Kevin Costner and Modern West album, \"\"Turn It On\"\", was released in February 2010 in Europe and was supported by a European tour. In July 2012, the band performed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the 20th annual Telus World Skins Game in support of the IWK Health Centre Foundation, donating a guitar autographed by Costner.\"',\n",
       " '829,\"Kevin Costner has also appeared in the documentary film \"\"Country Roads\"\" by Marieke Schröder.\"',\n",
       " '830,\"The most recent album released by Kevin Costner and Modern West, \"\"Tales from Yellowstone\"\", was written by Costner and his co-writers from the perspective of John Dutton, Costner\\'s character on the hit TV series \"\"Yellowstone\"\". Songs from the album were featured on Season 3 of the show.\"',\n",
       " '831,Baseball.',\n",
       " '832,\"Several of Costner\\'s films have included a baseball theme: \"\"Chasing Dreams\"\", \"\"Bull Durham\"\", \"\"Field of Dreams\"\", \"\"For Love of the Game\"\", and \"\"The Upside of Anger\"\", in three of which his character is a pro baseball player and one a former pro baseball player.\"',\n",
       " '833,\"Costner has a home in Austin, Texas, and sometimes appears at Texas Longhorns baseball practices and games. He was a close friend of former Longhorns baseball coach Augie Garrido from Garrido\\'s days coaching at Cal State Fullerton, Costner\\'s alma mater. He cast Garrido to play the role of the Yankee manager in \"\"For Love of the Game\"\". He tries to attend every College World Series game that CSUF Titans plays in Omaha, Nebraska. Costner walked-on for a try-out, but did not make the team early in his time at the university.\"',\n",
       " '834,\"Costner was a partial owner of the Zion, Illinois-based Lake County Fielders independent baseball team in the North American League. The Fielders name was an homage to \"\"Field of Dreams\"\", with the logo showing a ballplayer standing amid a field of corn.\"',\n",
       " '835,Business interests.',\n",
       " '836,\"In 1995, Costner began developing oil separation machines based on a patent he purchased from the US government. The machines developed by the company were of little commercial interest until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when BP took six of the machines from a company in which Costner owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010. On June 16, 2010, BP entered into a lease with Ocean Therapy Solutions for 32 of the oil-water separation devices. Although Spyron Contoguris and Stephen Baldwin previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64\\xa0million for securities fraud and misrepresentation. The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18-million down payment on a $52\\xa0million purchase, and that after the down payment, but before any announcement, another investor used part of the downpayment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale. The suit claimed that, despite public statements by Costner, Ocean Therapy Solutions, BP and others to the contrary, Baldwin and Contogouris were told that BP was still testing the machines and had not yet committed to lease the machines from Ocean Therapy Solutions and that the other investor in Ocean Therapy Solutions purchased their shares for $1.4\\xa0million to Baldwin and $500,000, to Contogouris. In June 2012, a federal jury in Louisiana deliberated for less than 2 hours before rejecting Baldwin\\'s and Contogouris\\' claims in the multimillion-dollar oil-clean-up case, and the court ordered Baldwin and Contogouris to reimburse Costner and the other defendants in the case for their costs.\"',\n",
       " '837,\"On June 6, 2004, Costner opened Tatanka: The Story of the Bison one mile south of Deadwood, South Dakota, on U.S. Route 85, for what he hoped would be an educational and emotional place for people to learn about America\\'s westward expansion. Promoters stated in a news release that the $5-million attraction had a new, 3,800-square-foot interactive center featuring exhibit, retail, and food and beverage areas, as well as offices and a small orientation theater. The visitor center features graphics, photographs, and text describing how bison came to North America and how Native American tribes used the animals for food, clothing, shelter, and other needs. The centerpiece is a bronze sculpture depicting a buffalo jump commonly used by Plains Indians to kill and process large numbers of animals on which they depended for survival. Hill City artist Peggy Detmers created 14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze Lakota riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 from Detmers. The five-fourths-scale bronzes, each weighing between 2,500 and 8,000 pounds, were cast at Eagle Bronze Foundry in Lander, Wyoming. The encampment features living Lakota interpreters of history, dressed in period attire and settled among their tipis.\"',\n",
       " '838,\"Costner opened the Midnight Star Casino and Restaurant in Deadwood, S.D., in 1991. He hired Francis and Carla Caneva to manage the establishment and gave each of them a 3.25 percent ownership and paid them salaries and bonuses. He terminated their employment in July 2004 and asked to agree to an amicable disassociation. When they declined, Costner dissolved the partnership and hired an accountant who determined its fair market value to be $3.1 million. The Canevas sued Costner to buy their shares based on twice that amount or sell the company on the open market. They won in the lower court but, on Costner’s appeal, lost in the South Dakota Supreme Court. Costner closed the establishment in 2017 and sold it in 2020.\"',\n",

       " '867,Plot.',\n",
       " '868,\"As the post-World War II baby boom explodes, an overworked stork (patterned after comedian Jimmy Durante) gets drunk in the Stork Club, complaining that he does all the work and the fathers get all the credit. Inexperienced animals; among them a dog with a propeller-powered tail carrying bundles of babies, four crows attempting to deliver an elephant, a pelican with simple devices to help haul the babies in its bill, and a mouse dragging a baby rhino; are among those commissioned to handle the increased workload as they take the babies to their parents. Babies are getting sent to the wrong parents; a mother goose is disgusted by her baby skunk, a baby kitten refuses to swim for its mother duck, a baby gorilla rides uncomfortably in the pouch of a Kangaroo, a Scottie Dog tries to rock his hippo to sleep, and two parents receive offspring that try to eat them—a kitten to a terrified mouse and an alligator to a pig.\"',\n",
       " '869,\"Porky Pig is brought in to manage Storks Inc. and its assembly line, with Daffy Duck as his assistant. While Daffy mans the phones, making quick references to Bing Crosby (\"\"I\\'m sorry, Bing, you\\'ve used up your quota.\"\"), Eddie Cantor (\"\"You say you haven\\'t got that boy yet?\"\") and the Dionne Quintuplets\\' father (\"\"Mr. Dionne, please!\"\"), Porky runs the control room, contacting references to Roydan Stork, Jimmy Doolittle as Jimmy Doo-quite-a-little, and a B-19. Then a dog worker, apparently research and development, comes into Porky\\'s door and said his skyrocket invention would speed things exponentially, but the rocket exploded before the send-off. It\\'s back to the drawing board for that idea.\"',\n",
       " '870,\"Then Daffy yells, \"\"Fffull-speed ahead!\"\" and Porky pulled the switch as the babies (among them Tweety in a brief cameo) are seen going through a conveyor belt (to the tune of Raymond Scott\\'s famous \"\"Powerhouse\"\") as they are diapered, fed milk and mechanically burped before they are sent by various animals, one of which is a baby hippo crying loudly and paused as it cutely said, \"\"I\\'m only 3½ seconds old,\"\" before resuming its wailing. When the milk feeding machine begins spraying milk over a puppy\\'s diaper, it begins crying as an alarm suddenly sounds. In response, Porky pulls a lever that sends the puppy to be given a rather quick bath.\"',\n",
       " '871,\"Problems, however, occur when Porky, reading the tags from the other babies, finds a stray egg is without an address and decides to have Daffy sit on it until it hatches. However, Daffy refuses to sit around on top of an egg and he said, \"\"Sittin\\' on eggs is out! O-W-T—Out!!\"\". Porky chases Daffy around the factory (complete with an imitation of Porky by Daffy) until they wind up trapped on the conveyor belt. The belt winds up stuffing both of them into one package (with Porky as the legs and Daffy as the top half) and sends them off to Africa via a stork-shaped skyrocket (Patent Pending), where a gorilla is waiting for her arrival. When the gorilla looks at the \"\"baby\"\" she sees Daffy Duck crying, Porky peeks through the diaper, saying, \"\"Uh, boo...\"\", causing the gorilla to cry on the telephone, \"\"Mr. Anthony, I have a problem!!\"\" (a reference to John J. Anthony, who conducted a daily radio advice program at the time called \"\"The Goodwill Hour\"\"; its stock phrase was \"\"I have a problem, Mr. Anthony\"\").\"',\n",

       " '897,\"In 2005, the Youth Commission authored a resolution advising the Mayor to evaluate the special needs of transitional young adults. In response, the Mayor formed the two-year Transitional Youth Task Force. Two-thirds of the Task Force\\'s members are adults; the remaining one-third are young adult advocates who have been involved with foster care, juvenile justice, mental health, special needs, alternative education, or other city systems relevant to transitional youth. Mayor Newsom allocated $500,000 in the FY2007 budget to form an official Interagency Council, which works with City departments who serve young adults to address gaps in available supportive services.\"',\n",
       " '898,\"The Task Force drafted 16 policy recommendations based on information gathered from focus groups involving over 100 youth across a range of systems. In 2007, the Task Force transformed into the Transition Age Youth San Francisco initiative (TAYSF) in order to implement these recommendations.

       " '970,Glenn Gould',\n",
       " '971,',\n",
       " '972,\"Glenn Herbert Gould (; né Gold; 25 September 19324 October 1982) was a Canadian classical pianist. He was one of the best known and most celebrated pianists of the 20th century, and was renowned as an interpreter of the keyboard works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Gould\\'s playing was distinguished by a remarkable technical proficiency and a capacity to articulate the contrapuntal texture of Bach\\'s music.\"',\n",
       " '973,\"Gould rejected most of the standard Romantic piano literature by Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and others, in favour of Bach and Beethoven mainly, along with some late-Romantic and modernist composers. Although his recordings were dominated by Bach and Beethoven, Gould\\'s repertoire was diverse, including works by Mozart, Haydn, and Brahms; pre-Baroque composers such as Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, William Byrd, and Orlando Gibbons; and 20th-century composers including Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, and Richard Strauss. Gould was known for his eccentricities, from his unorthodox musical interpretations and mannerisms at the keyboard to aspects of his lifestyle and behaviour. He stopped giving concerts at the age of 31 to concentrate on studio recording and other projects.\"',\n",
       " '974,\"Gould was also a writer, broadcaster, composer and conductor. He was a prolific contributor to musical journals, in which he discussed music theory and outlined his musical philosophy. He performed on television and radio, and produced three \"\"musique concrète\"\" radio documentaries called the \"\"Solitude Trilogy\"\", about isolated areas of Canada. Although Gould was known chiefly as a pianist, he capped off his musical career with a recording of Wagner\\'s Siegfried Idyll as conductor.\"',\n",
       " '975,Life.',\n",
       " '976,Early life.',\n",
       " '977,\"Glenn Herbert Gould was born at home in Toronto, on 25 September 1932, to Russell Herbert Gold (1901–1996) and Florence Emma Gold (née Greig; 1891–1975), Presbyterians of Scottish, English, and Norwegian ancestry. His maternal grandfather, John Charles Holman Greig, was a cousin of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, although John and his family spelled their name \"\"Greig\"\". Gould\\'s family\\'s surname was changed to Gould informally around 1939 to avoid being mistaken for Jewish, given the prevailing anti-Semitism of pre-war Toronto and the Jewish associations of the Gold surname. Gould had no Jewish ancestry, though he sometimes made jokes on the subject, such as \"\"When people ask me if I\\'m Jewish, I always tell them that I was Jewish during the war.\"\" His childhood home has been named a historic site.\"',\n",
       " '978,\"Gould\\'s interest in music and his talent as a pianist were evident very early. Both his parents were musical, and his mother, especially, encouraged the infant Gould\\'s early musical development. His mother, hoping for him to become a successful musician, had exposed him to music during her pregnancy. She would later teach him the piano. As a baby, he reportedly hummed instead of crying and wiggled his fingers as if playing chords, leading his doctor to predict that he would \"\"be either a physician or a pianist\"\". He learned to read music before he could read words, and it had been observed that, at age three, he had perfect pitch. When presented with a piano, the young Gould was reported to strike single notes and listen to their long decay, a practice his father Bert noted was different from typical children. Gould\\'s interest in the piano was concomitant with an interest in composition. He would play his own little pieces for family, friends, and sometimes large gatherings—including, in 1938, a performance at the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church (a few blocks from the Gould family home) of one of his own compositions.\"',\n",
       " '979,\"At the age of six, he was taken for the first time to hear a live musical performance by a celebrated soloist. This profoundly affected him. He later described the experience:\"',\n",
       " '980,\"It was Hofmann. It was, I think, his last performance in Toronto, and it was a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all \"\"orchestral\"\" sounds, but \"\"I\"\" was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.\"',\n",
       " '981,\"At the age of 10, he began attending the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto (known until 1947 as the Toronto Conservatory of Music). He studied music theory with Leo Smith, the organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back as a result of a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is almost certainly related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould\\'s mother would urge the young Gould to sit up straight at the keyboard. He used this famous chair for the rest of his life and took it with him almost everywhere. The chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low at the keyboard, and allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of his teacher at the Conservatory, Alberto Guerrero.\"',\n",
       " '982,\"Gould developed a technique that enabled him to choose a very fast tempo while retaining the \"\"separateness\"\" and clarity of each note. His extremely low position at the instrument permitted him more control over the keyboard. Gould showed considerable technical skill in performing and recording a wide repertoire including virtuosic and romantic works, such as his own arrangement of Ravel\\'s \"\"La valse\"\", and Liszt\\'s transcriptions of Beethoven\\'s Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. Gould worked from a young age with Guerrero on a technique known as finger-tapping: a method of training the fingers to act more independently from the arm.\"',\n",
       " '983,\"Gould passed his final Conservatory examination in piano at the age of 12, achieving the highest marks of any candidate, and thus attaining professional standing as a pianist at that age. One year later he had passed the written theory exams, qualifying for an Associate of the Toronto Conservatory of Music (ATCM) diploma.\"',\n",
       " '984,Piano.',\n",
       " '985,\"Gould was a child prodigy and was described in adulthood as a musical phenomenon. He claimed to have almost never practised on the piano itself, preferring to study repertoire by reading, another technique he had learned from Guerrero. He may have spoken ironically about his practising as there is evidence that, on occasion, he did practise quite hard, sometimes using his own drills and techniques.\"',\n",
       " '986,\"He stated that he did not understand the requirement of other pianists to continuously reinforce their relationship with the instrument by practising many hours a day. It seems that Gould was able to practise mentally without access to an instrument, once going so far as to prepare for a recording of Brahms\\' piano works without playing them until only a few weeks before the sessions. Gould could play from memory not just a vast repertoire of piano music, but also a wide range of orchestral and operatic transcriptions. He could \"\"memorize at sight\"\" and once challenged his friend John Roberts to name any piece of music that he could not \"\"instantly play from memory\"\".\"',\n",
       " '987,\"The piano, Gould said, \"\"is not an instrument for which I have any great love as such\\xa0... [but] I have played it all my life, and it is the best vehicle I have to express my ideas.\"\" In the case of Bach, Gould noted, \"\"[I] fixed the action in some of the instruments I play on—and the piano I use for all recordings is now so fixed—so that it is a shallower and more responsive action than the standard. It tends to have a mechanism which is rather like an automobile without power steering: you are in control and not it; it doesn\\'t drive you, you drive it. This is the secret of doing Bach on the piano at all. You must have that immediacy of response, that control over fine definitions of things.\"\"\"',\n",
       " '988,\"As a teenager, Gould was significantly influenced by Artur Schnabel, Rosalyn Tureck\\'s recordings of Bach (which he called \"\"upright, with a sense of repose and positiveness\"\"), and the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gould was known for having a vivid imagination. Listeners regarded his interpretations as ranging from brilliantly creative to outrightly eccentric. His pianism had great clarity and erudition, particularly in contrapuntal passages, and extraordinary control. Gould believed the piano to be \"\"a contrapuntal instrument,\"\" and his whole approach to music was, in fact, centered in the baroque. Much of the homophony that followed he felt belongs to a less serious and less spiritual period of art.\"',\n",
       " '989,\"Gould had a pronounced aversion to what he termed \"\"hedonistic\"\" approaches to piano repertoire, performance, and music generally. For Gould, \"\"hedonism\"\" in this sense denoted a superficial theatricality, something to which he felt Mozart, for example, became increasingly susceptible later in his career. He associated this drift towards hedonism with the emergence of a cult of showmanship and gratuitous virtuosity on the concert platform in the 19th century and later. The institution of the public concert, he felt, degenerated into the \"\"blood sport\"\" with which he struggled, and which he ultimately rejected.\"',\n",
       " '990,Performances.',\n",
       " '991,\"On 5 June 1938, at the age of five, Gould played in public for the first time, joining his family on stage to play piano at a church service at the Business Men\\'s Bible Class in Uxbridge, Ontario, in front of a congregation of about two thousand. In 1945, at the age of thirteen, he made his first appearance with an orchestra in a performance of the first movement of Beethoven\\'s 4th Piano Concerto with the Toronto Symphony. His first solo recital followed in 1947, and his first recital on radio was with the CBC in 1950. This was the beginning of Gould\\'s long association with radio and recording. He founded the Festival Trio chamber group in 1953 with the cellist Isaac Mamott and the violinist Albert Pratz.\"',\n",
       " '992,\"In 1957, Gould undertook a tour of the Soviet Union, becoming the first North American to play there since World War II. His concerts featured Bach, Beethoven, and the serial music of Schoenberg and Berg, which had been suppressed in the Soviet Union during the era of Socialist Realism. Gould made his Boston debut in 1958, playing for the Peabody Mason Concert Series. On 31 January 1960, Gould made his American television debut on CBS\\'s \"\"Ford Presents\"\" series, performing Bach\\'s Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in D minor (BWV 1052) with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic.\"',\n",
       " '993,\"Gould was convinced that the institution of the public concert was not only an anachronism, but also a \"\"force of evil\"\", leading to his retirement from concert performance. He argued that public performance devolved into a sort of competition, with a non-empathetic audience (musically and otherwise) mostly attendant to the possibility of the performer erring or not meeting critical expectation. He set forth this doctrine, only half in jest, in \"\"GPAADAK\"\", the Gould Plan for the Abolition of Applause and Demonstrations of All Kinds. On 10 April 1964, Gould gave his last public performance, playing in Los Angeles, at the Wilshire Ebell Theater. Among the pieces he performed that night were Beethoven\\'s Piano Sonata No. 30, selections from Bach\\'s \"\"The Art of Fugue\"\", and Paul Hindemith\\'s Piano Sonata No. 3. Gould performed fewer than 200 concerts over the course of his career, of which fewer than 40 were outside Canada. For a pianist such as Van Cliburn, 200 concerts would have amounted to about two years\\' touring.\"',\n",
       " '994,\"One of Gould\\'s reasons for abandoning live performance was his aesthetic preference for the recording studio, where, in his words, he developed a \"\"love affair with the microphone\"\". There, he could control every aspect of the final musical \"\"product\"\" by selecting parts of various takes. He felt that he could realize a musical score more fully this way. Thus, the act of musical composition, to Gould, did not entirely end with the original score. The performer had to make creative choices. Gould felt strongly that there was little point in re-recording centuries-old pieces if the performer had no new perspective to bring to the work. For the rest of his life, Gould eschewed live performance, focusing instead on recording, writing, and broadcasting.\"',\n",
       " '995,Eccentricities.',\n",
       " '996,\"Gould was widely known for his unusual habits. He often hummed or sang while he played, and his audio engineers were not always successful in excluding his voice from recordings. Gould claimed that his singing was unconscious and increased in proportion to his inability to produce his intended interpretation from a given piano. It is likely that this habit originated in his having been taught by his mother to \"\"sing everything that he played\"\", as his biographer Kevin Bazzana puts it. This became \"\"an unbreakable (and notorious) habit\"\". Some of Gould\\'s recordings were severely criticised because of this background \"\"vocalising\"\". For example, a reviewer of his 1981 re-recording of the \"\"Goldberg Variations\"\" opined that many listeners would \"\"find the groans and croons intolerable\"\". Gould was renowned for his peculiar body movements while playing and for his insistence on absolute control over every aspect of his environment. The temperature of the recording studio had to be precisely regulated. He invariably insisted that it had to be extremely warm. According to another of Gould\\'s biographers, Otto Friedrich, the air-conditioning engineer had to work just as hard as the recording engineers.\"',\n",
       " '997,\"The piano had to be set at a certain height and would be raised on wooden blocks if necessary. A small rug would sometimes be required for his feet underneath the piano. He had to sit exactly fourteen inches above the floor, and would play concerts only while sitting on the old chair his father had made. He continued to use this chair even when the seat was completely worn through. His chair is so closely identified with him that it is shown in a place of honour in a glass case at the National Library of Canada.\"',\n",
       " '998,\"Conductors had mixed responses to Gould and his playing habits. George Szell, who led Gould in 1957 with the Cleveland Orchestra, remarked to his assistant, \"\"That nut\\'s a genius.\"\" Leonard Bernstein said, \"\"There is nobody quite like him, and I just love playing with him.\"\" Bernstein created a stir at the concert of April 6, 1962 when, just before the New York Philharmonic was to perform the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor with Gould as soloist, he informed the audience that he was assuming no responsibility for what they were about to hear. He asked the audience: \"\"In a concerto, who is the bossthe soloist or the conductor?\"\", to which the audience laughed. \"\"The answer is, of course, sometimes the one and sometimes the other, depending on the people involved.\"\" Specifically, Bernstein was referring to their rehearsals, with Gould\\'s insistence that the entire first movement be played at half the indicated tempo. The speech was interpreted by Harold C. Schonberg, music critic for \"\"The New York Times\"\", as an abdication of responsibility and an attack on Gould. Plans for a studio recording of the performance came to nothing. The live radio broadcast was subsequently released on CD, Bernstein\\'s disclaimer included.\"',\n",
